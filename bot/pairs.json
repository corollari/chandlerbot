Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.

(Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)"}, {"answer": "So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too? ", "question": "Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. "}, {"answer": "I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.", "question": "No... he killed his father with a shovel.

"}, {"answer": "(struggling) Oh, really? ", "question": "(To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)"}, {"answer": "O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?", "question": "No! (To Monica) You we're right, that *was* fun! I'm gonna go finish packing."}, {"answer": "Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it? ", "question": "Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is."}, {"answer": "How do you know? ", "question": "(smiling) No it's not. "}, {"answer": "Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we *never* do?", "question": "Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
