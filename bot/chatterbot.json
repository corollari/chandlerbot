(turns and goes towards \n  his room)", "(following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. \n  (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)"], ["a liar.", "What did I just say?"], ["You still here?", "Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am \n  insulted. When I tell somebody I did something..."], ["Now, what do you say?", "Lying is wrong!"], ["And?... AND?", "I'm a pretty little girl."], ["Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.", "That's funny, we were doing the same thing!"], ["It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea \n  how expensive this stuff was!", "Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the \n  numbers."], ["So what did you two do about it?", "It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting \n  solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell."], ["I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!", "(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!"], ["Hey!", "Hey!"], ["What's going on?", "Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning \n  the apartment."], ["(sarcastically) We?", "You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!"], ["Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?", "Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live."], ["Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very \n  impressive when the little people know a celebrity.", "(pointing at himself) Little people?"], ["Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff \n  hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?", "What...? NO!"], ["Chandler?", "(he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended \n  by the insinuation!"], ["Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes \n  taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?", "I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not \n  mine."], ["Ok.", "Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door \n  and both are smiling exaggeratedly)"], ["Yay!", "But you already gave all your money to charity!"], ["Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just ask for it back!", "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you can do that!"], ["Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really excited \n  about getting this process started.", "Oh, because we love kids. Love \u00e2\u0080\u0098em to death.Well, not actually \n  to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... \n  as allowed by law."], ["Oh...", "What?"], ["Yes!", "Of course it was!"], ["So you're not friends with him?", "OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, \n  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!"], ["Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...", "(Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!"], ["What's going on?", "WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!! "], ["Is he alright out there by himself?", "Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie."], ["Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.", "Well, we're not."], ["But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!", "We don't have a code word."], ["(To Chandler) What room should we see next?", "Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)"], ["Ok, ok! (He leaves)", "Ok!"], ["Oh my God!", "And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And \n  we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)"], ["Are you friends with him?", "I can explain... Joey..."], ["(laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...", "Oh, that's really ok."], ["Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... \n  Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)", "Wrong number?"], ["It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on \n  the waiting list.", "That's great!"], ["Previously on Friends...", "How did the job stuff go?"], ["So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?", "Or facing a bitch of a commute."], ["I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... \n  ", "My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica \n  looks at him and can't really place what he just said)"], ["You okay with this?", "Well, it makes me feel sad, but..."], ["Talking to Ross.", "I see."], ["How is that gonna happen?", "Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?"], ["Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next \n  door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna \n  take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.", "We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse \n  us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright."], ["But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?", "What do you think Pheebs?"], ["Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin \n  Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?", "Yeah."], ["She died.", "You're kidding!"], ["Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across \n  the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the \n  wrong one.", "Oh yeah? "], ["Joey's gonna be *so* upset. ", "I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the \n  Atlantic."], ["Thanks.", "It feels like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cheating on our house. \n  And if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna cheat, shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it be with like a hot, younger house, \n  that does stuff that our house won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do?"], ["No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)", "(To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?"], ["Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. \n  Maybe the ", "The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple \n  are the Hitlers."], ["Okay, you come up with an idea.", "Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on \n  our house. We can still get out."], ["our house.", "Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder \n  out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) \"Oh My God\"! \n"], ["Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever \n  we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. \n  I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls \n  jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking \n  it pushing something up)", "(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we \n  have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly \n  outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)"], ["All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see \n  you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)", "Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to \n  be here."], ["Oh, me too... (laughs)", "Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off."], ["Huh?", "I never stopped loving you."], ["Oh... my...", "Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice \n  Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein."], ["Chandler, what are you talking about?", "Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and \n  Monica never have to know a thing."], ["I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... \n  heat between us.", "(stunned) Obviously."], ["But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't \n  think we should get this house now.", "Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away."], ["Chandler, one of us has got to be ", "I understand."], ["Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses \n  Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks \n  at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)", "(speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now."]]}
