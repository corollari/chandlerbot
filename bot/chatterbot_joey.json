Why?!", "Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first.

And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me."], ["I gave you my number, you never called me.", "No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do."], [" Well, I'm pretty sure I gave    you my number.", "Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?"], ["I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...", "No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? "], ["Joey, wait!", " NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... "], ["I got a really incredible job offer.", "Hey, great! All right!"], ["It's in Paris.", "What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,    okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid    suburbs..."], ["Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...", "Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it."], ["Of course we can. Congratulations.     Yay!  Joey...", "No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA."], [" Joey, it would mean so...", "Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. "], ["Hey. Everything ok?", "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just mad at my agent."], ["Estelle? Why?", "There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be put up for it!

All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her.", "Ok. Why?"], ["Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.    ", "I love that saying!"], ["It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little coincidental, but believable.    .

Look, I know she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna call her and hire her again."], ["No, no, no! Don't call her!

I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"], ["Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...", "No, no, no!  Don't drop by,    don't drop by!"], ["Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.", "Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?"], [" It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with    the career. You're gonna be huge.", "Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.     \"out of area\". Boy, I'll say."]]}
