I just thought he was nice, y'know? 
 I can't believe you didn't know it was a line! 
===
 Are you through with that? 
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
===
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. 
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
===
Well? Isn't that amazing? 
What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
===
Since when? 
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. 
===
And everybody knows this? 
Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
===
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
===
Hey, that was really good! 
Thanks! Let's keep going. 
===
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" 
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke." 
===
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. 
What? 
===
Not so much! 
Whoah! 
===
Hey! 
Hey! 
===
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. 
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. 
===
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. 
Y'miss it? 
===
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. 
What are you talking about? Keep it! 
===
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. 
So when do we get to meet the guy? 
===
 Yeah. 
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
===
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? 
Alan. 
===
Well, I-I could live without it. 
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? 
===
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. 
Oh,  "you do, do you"? 
===
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?! 
 What's going on? 
===
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
===
Uh, Joey.. 
Oh, God!  
===
We didn't change.. 
So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
===
Look, I- I could go on pretending- 
Okay! 
===
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
===
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
No plans, huh?
===
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. 
===
Hi, Joey.
My god, Angela.
===
Are you gonna go over there?
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela. 
===
 Joey.
You look good.
===
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
You don't say.
===
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
===
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
===
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
What?
===
We're just friends.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
===
What four of us?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
===
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
===
 Oh, god help us.
What?
===
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
===
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
 I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
===
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Yep.
===
Which?
Which what?
===
You've never met Bob, have you?
No, but he's...
===
How, how did that happen?
Oh my god.
===
What?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
===
Yep. Pretty much.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
===
Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
===
Monica, Monica is great.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
===
Oh my god.
What?
===
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Come on, they're close.
===
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
===
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'sÂnot really true, is it?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
===
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
===
 Oh! 
Ow!
===
 I'm outta here.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
===
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
===
Hey, how'd it go?
Excellent.
===
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Whadja think?
===
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
===
What is it?
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
===
'We' would be me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
===
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
I couldn't do it.
===
Good for you, Joey.
that I'm going out with more people than she is.
===
Well, what's the part?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
===
Seriously, what-what's the part?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
===
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
...I'm his 
===
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
===
 Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
===
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
===
For what?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
===
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Thank you! 
===
...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
===
Lose the robe.
Me?
===
That would work.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.
===
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
===
No, that was clenching.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
===
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
===
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Nope.
===
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
I got fired.
===
Oh!
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
===
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
===
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
===
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Hard to tell, I was naked.
===
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Yeah? That's so nice! 
===
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
===
 Put Joey on the phone.
What's up man?
===
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth 
 Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen. 
===
That's my sister.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
===
Step back.
We have a winner!
===
 What?
You and Rachel.
===
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
===
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
===
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' 
===
 OK, here goes.
Are you going to do it?
===
I'm going to do it.
Do you want any help?
===
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Good luck, man.
===
Thanks.  OK.
OK. 
===
Outside.
You can't go out there.
===
Why not?
Because of... the reason.
===
And that would be?
I, um, can't tell you.
===
Joey, what's going on?
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
===
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
===
Oh my God! I love him!
 You'd better act surprised.
===
Well, he didn't tell me.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
===
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
 Bwah-hah-hah!
===
Oh.. oh... oh.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
===
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Not me.
===
Twice.
Twice?
===
Oh, that sucks!
You guys okay?
===
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
===
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
 Morning. We ready to go?
===
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. 
===
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
===
Whaddya got there?
 Just a, uh... hearing disability.
===
What's the score?
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
===
Looks like a fun gang. 
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
===
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
===
What were you modeling for?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
===
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...  
===
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Thanks.
===
You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Yeah.
===
We all chipped in.
 We did?
===
We did?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis? 
===
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
===
Get out.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
===
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
===
 Nothing.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
===
Yeah.  Oh.
What's wrong?
===
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh. What?
===
Um, leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
===
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
===
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
===
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?
===
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
===
Well then get it, get it!
That tone will not make me go any faster.
===
 Joey!
That one will. 
===
Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
===
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
===
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious? 
===
 Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Oh, I will.
===
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
===
So, how'd it go?
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
===
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
===
So what are you gonna be?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
===
Okay, we're gonna take a short break. 
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
===
Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
Nice shoes, huh? 
===
Yeah.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
===
 Okay, here we go...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
===
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Uh, four.
===
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
===
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
===
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
===
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
 Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
===
 And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight. 
You seen Sandy?
===
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
===
So I'm kissing everyone?
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
===
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Alrightalrightalright.  There.
===
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
===
No way, forget it.
C'mon, she's your mom!
===
Hey, is Chandler here?
Yeah.
===
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Right. No big deal.
===
Okay. 
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
===
What code?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
===
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
===
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
===
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
===
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
You don't think my mom's sexy?
===
Well... not in the same way...
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
===
Well, not playing raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
===
Why would I tell him?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
===
 What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
===
 You knew about this?
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
===
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
===
Chandler-
Me neither, y'know what-
===
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
What are you mad at me for?!
===
You gotta let me slam the door! 
 Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code?
===
Joey-
Ah!  Huh? 
===
Okay.  I am so hot!
 Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
===
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
===
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? 
 Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up.
===
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
===
You're kidding.
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
===
Wow!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
===
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
That makes more sense.
===
So, what's going on now?
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
===
Whaddya see?
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
===
What's a 'niffle'?
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
===
 Hello!
 How come you don't live with Mommy?  How come Mommy lives with that other lady?  What's a lesbian? 
===
Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm 
 Mma, Mma, Mmaah
===
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.
===
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?
===
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?
===
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
===
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah
===
You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
===
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why, are you moving out?
===
I'm not moving out. 
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
===
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
===
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
===
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
So what's it gonna be? 
===
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Or an uncle... 
===
Oh, right, that's me!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
===
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
===
That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
===
 What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
===
You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
===
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
===
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
===
 Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
===
What, now?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
===
Wha-
Wha-
===
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Hey!
===
Hey!
We already knew that! 
===

Shut-out!! 
===
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
===
 What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Dad, dad. 
===
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
 Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
===
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. 
Sure. So how long you been... 
===
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Since then?!
===
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
...I d'know.
===
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk. 
===
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
===
 Oh, good. Rog is here.
What's the matter with Rog?
===
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
===
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
===
Hey, Joe.
Dad, Ronni's here.
===
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Who-ah-ho.
===
 We'll go to a hotel.
No you won't.
===
No we won't.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
===
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
===
Wow. He's strict.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
===
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late." 
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
===
What kinda change?
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
===
I can't do that!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
===
Yeah, but this is
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
===
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. 
===
Well, you're gonna.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
===
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
===
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
===
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
You really think so?
===
Yeah. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler. 
===
I came to give you this  and this. 
Oww! Big ring!
===
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. 
Hold on, you-you knew?
===
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
===
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
===
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'm...happy...for you?
===
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
===
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
===
That's sweet. Could I take her?
With this ring?  No contest.
===
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
===
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
===
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. 
===
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
===
She lent me an egg once.
You're in!
===
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÂI don't think we need a third... 
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
===
An egg?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
===
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
===
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
===
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Pathetic mess? I know, butÂcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
===
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. 
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. 
===
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
 Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
===
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
===
 What? What can't you do?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
===
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
===
Ok, you can not do this to me.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
===
 Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
===
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
 Whoa.
===
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
===
 Oh. That WENUS.
So what're you going to do?
===
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
===
speaking metaphorically.
 So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?
===
Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
===
 OK, try this salmon mousse.
 Mmmm. Good.
===
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It's creamier.
===
Yeah, well, is that 
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
===
 Waitressing?
Uh-oh.
===
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
 Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
===
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
===
 Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
===
OK.  I'm in my apartment...
....yeah... what else?
===
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. 
 Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
===
 Wow.
Alright, now you say something.
===
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
===
Yeah.
You want to see her again, right?
===
Sure.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
===
OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
 Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
===
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
===
....and....
Say it... say it!
===
 Funny story!
You're not going to believe this!
===
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
===
Again?
And again, and again, and again...  Hello?  And again.
===
Oh, I was unbelievable.
All right, Ross!
===
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
You cuddled.
===
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
===
 Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
===
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Thank you.
===
 We were playing poker, alright...
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
===
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
===
OOooooo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
===
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
About what?
===
Oh. Right.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
===
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... 
...Yeah?
===
You are way off, pal.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
===
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
===
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
===
Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
===
I want to go to the bathroom. 
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. 
===
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
to hold me over.
===
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
===
Me too.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
===
OK Joey, your bet.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.  Oh, I'm out.
===
Yeah.......OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
===
Alright, check.
Check.
===
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
===
Alright, here's ten. 
Here, I got five, I got five. 
===
 Bye... bye... 
Oh!
===
So good!
Suck-fest.
===
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
===
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
===
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
She really said that?
===
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
'Tonight' tonight?
===
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
===
Marcel?
Marcel?
===
Marcel?
Marcel?
===
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
A monkey.
===
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
===
Of course.
Oh. Then, no.
===
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
===
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
===
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Marcel?
===
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
===
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
===
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
Her answer machine?
===
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Duh, where've you been?
===
Great, now he's waving back.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
===
What kinda stuff?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
===
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
===
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Maybe she never got your message.
===
Hell is filled with people like you.
 He's back! The peeper's back!
===
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
 Yeah?
===
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
..Naughty!
===
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah...
===
Thanks.
 Hey, you know our phone's not working?
===
What?!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
===
Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
===
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
 Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
===
Rdtor.
 Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
===
So she's a woman! So what?
Yeah. Yeah, so what?  Look, I live across the street,  and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay?  Yeah, I can see you right now!  Hello!  If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel likeÂÂThank you, but... that's not really the point...  The point is that...  Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
===
Joey!!
 Yeah, my neighbor...  Yeah, the brunette...  She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
===
The green dress? Really?
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
===
How about Joey... Pepponi?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
===
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
===
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
 Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
===
 Hi.
Hey.
===
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
 Hey! He beat ya.
===
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
===
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
===
What?
Did you call the cops?
===
Oh, somebody will.
a Joseph Stalin?
===
You're kidding.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
===
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
===
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
===
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
===
Just, just say what you feel.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
===
Next. 
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
===
Wow!
Exellent dream score.
===
 Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
I don't know. What are you wearing?
===
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
===
Oh, it's my new beeper.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
===
Thank you.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
===
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
===
 Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.  No, AndrÃ© is not here.  Third time today.  Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Services?  Oh, services.
===
Oh, oh Chandler...
Oh... Yeah, you do.
===
 My scones.
scones.'
===
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there.  Joey was there too.
All right. 
===
Huh!
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
===
 You know what?
What?
===
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Sorry.
===
It's morphin time!
Stegosaurus!
===
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
What about AndrÃ©?
===
True story.
They're here already?
===
Are you're hands still wet?
Uh, moist, yeah.
===
Joey, get out of the fridge.
All right, all right. 
===
What is that? 
For the ride.
===
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
===
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
===
Knick fan?
Oh, yeah.
===
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Hey, listen, lady.......whoa.
===
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
===
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
===
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
===
There is no father.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
===
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
===
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here.  What do you mean, Joey who?  Joey who?
Tribbiani.
===
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on.  She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
 Hi, yeah, it's me.  Oh, no no no, we're just friends.  Yeah, I'm single.  25.  An actor.  Hello?
===
She's not much of a phone person.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
===
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. 
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
===
Maybe you should.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? 
===
Oh, that is so not true.
Oh, it is.
===
It isn't.
It is.
===
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
 Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
===
Where have you been?
Oh, just had a baby.
===
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
===
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
===
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.  Look, he's opening his eyes.  
He doesn't do much, does he?
===
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
===
... And where's this money coming from? 
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
===
 What kind of research?
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
===
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. 
... It's a fertility study.
===
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your 
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
===
 Men are here.
We make fire. Cook meat.
===
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Oh, OK.
===
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your  special someone?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
===
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
===
Man's got a point.
wants to have sex with me.
===
Crazy bitch.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
===
Hi.
Hey!
===
....I have to go to China.
The country?
===
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
===
about her.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
===
Yeah... I guess. I don'tÂI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? 
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
===
I know.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. 
===
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
===
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
===
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there 
What do you mean?
===
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
: That book got me through some tough times.
===
 Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
 That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
===
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
===
 H-He's in China!
The country.
===
Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
===
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
===
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! 
 Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
===
 M-Me again?
Sure! Why not?
===
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
How do you mean?
===
Hey, big...
Shhhh!
===
 ...spender.
She's still asleep.
===
So how'd it go?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
===
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
===
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
===
I didn't know you had another level.
I know! Neither did I!
===
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
===
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? 
===
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Um, this?
===
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.Â  Phoebe.Â  Joey, what up?
What up?!
===
 Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Needs some clothes altered?
===
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990?
===
 Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
===
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
===
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
===
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Can we see her?
===
I'm okay.
Ooh, that bad, huh? 
===
What?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
===
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
===
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
===
I don't know, I don't know.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
===
 Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
===
What?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
===
Cupping.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
===
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
What? That's not?  Oh my God.
===
Okay. 
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
===
You know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. 
 I gotta get one, too.
===
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
===
Sure.
Uh, does it hurt?
===
It did at first, but not anymore.
Chandler?
===
As much as he needs.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
===
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Who?
===
 Hombre? 
What's he doin' in my section?
===
I guess he doesn't know.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok?  Hey, how ya doin'?
===
Mornin'. 
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
===
Your territory, huh?
Yeah. Bijan for men?
===
You bet.  Maybe some other time?
 Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?! 
===
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
What is the big deal? 
===
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
===
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
===
Howdy.
 Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
===
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
===
 What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
===
 All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Yeah I guess you're right.
===
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I'm gonna do it. 
===
Ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.
===
 My god, what happened?
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
===
Morning.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
===
 Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up.  Good morning Joey.
 Good morning.
===
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
 Kiss her! Kiss her!
===
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
===
Nope, not this time.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
===
you.
This is Janice.
===
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
===
What are you the memory woman?
 Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
===
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
===
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
===
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
===
Hey!
Wheel!
===
Of!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!!
===
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
===
No, Janice.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
===
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
===
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
===
Well, there you go.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
===
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Look, what do you want me to say?
===
I want you to say that you like her!
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. 
===
Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? 
===
So, I hear, you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
===
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
===
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
But what does that gonna do...
===
For Chandler!
Okay. I'm in.
===
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
===
We're baack!
Hey!
===
Really.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
===
You still can't stand her can you?
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
===
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
===
Well, I guess that's something.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
===
Okay.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
===
Oh God!
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
===
Really?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
===
Aww, is it broken?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. 
===
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
===
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What is this? Fruit?
===
Monica's making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
===
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.  Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. 
This will just be my batch.
===
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
 You talked to him. Are you crazy?
===
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
 Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean  
===
Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.
Aww.  Ohh!
===
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam. 
Put your hands together.
===
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
No more jam?!
===
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
===
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.  Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
===
Joey, this is you!
Let me see.  Oh, right.
===
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
===
And that's how you bought it?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
===
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
===
Thank you, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
===
Hey.
Where you going?
===
To the bank.
Sperm or regular?
===
Sperm.
So you're really doing this, huh?
===
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. 
Sounds nice.
===
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
No kiddin', hmm. 
===
What?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
===
Really? Why?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
===
Hoyt?
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
===
Really, is he a swimmer?
He's got the body for it.
===
I like that.  What?
You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
===
We do not have one of those signs.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
===
Two girls and a boy?
Yeah!
===
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too. 
===
Yeah.
Oh Monica.  Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool,  for like a day. .
===
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
 Did I get it?
===
Oh, oh! It's on again!
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
===
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
 Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
===
And there is Kevin.
Can we please turn this off?
===
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  Go ahead.  This works with any milk carton.
 Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.
===
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.
 Hey!
===
Hey, man. What's up?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
===
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me! 
How is it you?
===
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. 
Yep, that's my audition.
===
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
===
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
===
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh . 
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
===
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Hang up, hang up. 
===
 I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
I love that movie. 
===
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
===
 Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
===
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Hey, you know about that?!
===
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
===
You think?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
===
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Come on baby, come on!
===
Unbelievable.
Thank you so much.
===
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
===
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
===
Two?
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
===
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Nooo, four.
===
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Go Joe!!!
===
 Helloo! Oh! 
Pheebs! There you are!
===
No it's not, sorry.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! 
===
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
===
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay, these things happen.
===
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
I'm, I'm okay. See. 
===
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
===
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
They actually said that?
===
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.
===
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. 
Okay, shoot.
===
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
I didn't get it?
===
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that. 
Okay, what else?
===
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Oh.
===
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
===
Oh.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
===
Yeah, no, I understand.
You do, thanks.
===
Yeah. Sorry. 
Wait a minute.
===
What?
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
===
 Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
 That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
No. Y'know how weÂre always saying we need a place for the mail.
===
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
===
YouÂre building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. ItÂs a one day job, max.
===
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio ValenteÂs.
===
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Her what?
===
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
===
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
ItÂs just a game Mon.  Rach, how about you?
===
Joey.
Hey-hey!
===
You know, we donÂt really take advantage of living in the city.
I know.
===
want this unit!!
Well, you shouldÂve told me that before, IÂm not a mind reader. Hey, weÂre out of beer. IÂm going to MonicaÂs.
===
Hey! Where Âya headinÂ in those pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
===
Why, whatÂs wrong with my bathroom floor?
Nothing. ItÂs just old and dingy, thatÂs all.
===
I highly doubt that. 
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.  Yeah.
===
I canÂt live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off. 
===
ThatÂs a little more than I wanted to see.
 Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. ItÂd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. 
===
Oh, just this!  YÂknow what itÂs my fault really, because the couch is usually where we 
 Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
===
Well, itÂs about time.
Ooh, very official.
===
Okay, on three. One....Two....
Why donÂt we just go on two.
===
Why two?
Because itÂs faster.
===
Oh!
All right, but in the future...
===
Okay, one...two...
So we are going on two?
===
Oh, good job Joe.
Wow, itÂs big!
===
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! 
Maybe, my rulerÂs wrong.
===
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Look itÂs not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
===
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how Âbout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? 
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
===
Umm?
I bet Âya ya I could fit in there. 
===
IÂve got five bucks says you canÂt.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
===
Yeah, you got me.  IÂm out five big ones!  Here you go.
Thank you. Cha-ching!  Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy.  And the drinks are on me!
===
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Well, thatÂs really a different question.
===
IÂm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
===
Excuse me, there was no time!
Okay, but letÂs say there was. How might that go?
===
Yeah, IÂll take some.
Hey, thereÂs a dog out there!
===
 Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by,  Bye-bye.
DonÂt you ah, donÂt you wanna ask me any questions?
===
Sure. Ummm. WhatÂs up?
Well, ah, IÂm an actor. IÂm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and donÂt worry IÂm totally okay with the gay thing.
===
What gay thing?
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. IÂm totally cool with that.
===
Hi.
Hey!
===
Hi, again.
Hey! 
===
You want some help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I donÂt!
===
Whoa! Are you okay?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
===
ItÂs the heat.  And-and the humidity.
ThatÂs a uh, thatÂs a tough combination.
===
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Like you wouldnÂt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
===
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
===
This place is really my GrandmotherÂs.  I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, IÂm 87 year old woman, whoÂs afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Oh, you bet I am!
===
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
===
So?!
Whoa, ah!! WeÂre you just gonna give me some lemonade?
===
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Oh right, right.
===
I donÂt believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. IÂm such a jerk.
===
WhatÂs it about?
Lifeguards.
===
Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  WhoÂs she?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
===
Wow! Look at them run.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
===
Yeah, IÂll go get one.
No, no, no, donÂt get up, I got a cooler right here.
===
My wifeÂs a lesbian.
Cool!!
===
I was always Joanne.
Question. Was ah, ÂEgg the Gellers!Â the war cry of your neighbourhood?
===
Ewww! Oh! ItÂs the Mattress King!
Booo!!
===
Yeah, weÂll see!
 Hey, you guys!
===
Hey!
Guess what?
===
What?
I got a gig!
===
WhatÂs the part?
Well, itÂs not a part, no. IÂm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
===
Wow!
Yeah, yeah. ItÂs like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
===
YÂknow your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
 I know!
===
Oh, yay!
Yeah, itÂs this great part, this boxer named Nick. And IÂm so, so right for it, y'know, heÂs just like me. Except heÂs a boxer, and has an evil twin.
===
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. ItÂs that bedroom there. 
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
===
Yeah, so please, please, please, donÂt say anything to Chandler.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
===
Is that a problem?
No.
===
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer letÂs see what you got. All right ya, put Âem up. Come on. 
Hey, youÂre ah, pretty good at this.
===
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men werenÂt acting Christian enough.
Ahh!
===
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Okay, great.
===
Wow! And IÂm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well IÂm sorry, weÂll put some ice on it. 
Okay.
===
ÂKay, put your head back.
All right. I canÂt see.
===
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
===
Guess what, I got an audition!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. IÂm so proud.
===
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! WhatÂs the part?
===
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thatÂs not gonna be me, not me.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
===
No.
Whoa. That was really good.
===
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Well, I-I mightÂve said supergay.
===
Joey, youÂre this guyÂs teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Because, Monica, the guyÂs so good, and I really, really want this part.
===
Look, itÂs like I told you, thereÂs nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
===
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, IÂm talking to the king. 
===
Although, donÂt feel like you canÂt visit.
 Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
===
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
===
Joey, you canÂt keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
ItÂll kill him. I mean itÂll, itÂll just kill him.
===
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
What did they do?
===
You? You! Want to watch Ben?  Yes! ThatÂd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. 
Hey-hey, Ross?
===
Yeah.
IÂve got a science question.
===
Hmm?
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ÂHomo-sapienÂ, is that why there extinct?
===
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Hey-hey, IÂm not judging.
===
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
IÂd really prefer a mountain bike.
===
JaniceÂs birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
===
ThatÂs a good idea, ÂDear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthdayÂ. I would like to get her something serious.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
===
All right. Look, IÂm gonna go in here, and you donÂt buy me anything ever. 
 No, no, you canÂt, you canÂt, okay, you canÂt, you canÂt buy her pearls, you just canÂt, you canÂt, you canÂt.
===
Why not?!
Oh God. Uh, okay, hereÂs the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
===
What is the thing?
Okay. I went down to the ÂMattress KingÂ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
===
 What?
They were in his office.
===
Well she, she wouldnÂt do that, sheÂs with, sheÂs with me.
IÂm telling you man, I saw it.
===
Yeah, well, youÂre wrong! Okay, youÂre wrong.
IÂm not wrong! I wish I was. IÂm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnÂt sound so bad now, huh?
===
Monica, number one, I donÂt think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
You said number two.
===
I also said number one.
I know. 
===
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Uh.
===
What?
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. 
===
Well maybe heÂs just taking a nap.
IÂm tellinÂ ya, he hasnÂt moved since this morning.
===
How are we gonna do that? ThereÂs no way.
Well, there is one way. His windowÂs open, I say, we poke him.
===
Yeah.
Well, now we got a reason.
===
What?
Well, weÂre fashioning a very long poking device.
===
All right.
Hey uh, whatÂs a matter?
===
I talked to Janice.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
===
She doesnÂt know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I canÂt even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
===
I donÂt know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Well, it doesnÂt matter what I would do.
===
Come on, tell me.
All right, youÂre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out.
===
What?  What are you, what are you talking about?
They have a kid together, y'know. TheyÂre like, theyÂre like a family, and if, I donÂt know, thereÂs chance they could make that work, I know I wouldnÂt want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
===
IÂm telling you heÂs dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, letÂs poke.  Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, weÂre approaching the window  Thread the needle. Thread the needle. 
===
And yet, weÂre still poking him.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
===
Hey-hey, now heÂs showing us his poking device.
Hey, thatÂs never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
===
Halftime.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
===
Oh, can I play too? IÂve never played football, like ever. 
Great, you can cover Chandler.
===
No, no, no, I donÂt, I donÂt really wanna play.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
===
ThatÂs not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. DonÂt say that I donÂt have goals!
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe itÂll take your mind off Janice, and if you donÂt play, everyone will be mad at you Âcause the teams wonÂt be even. Come on.
===
Um, Monica and I arenÂt supposed to play football.
Says who? Your mom?
===
 That almost hit me in the face.
All right, we have to pick captains.
===
Well, why donÂt we just bunny up.
What?
===
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Thank you.
===
Huddle up.
 All right, huddle up, right over here.
===
 Hike!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
===
 You are playing American football?
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
===
IÂm Dutch.
Hi-hi, IÂm Joey.
===
IÂm Margha.
IÂm sorry Dutch, I didnÂt get that last little bit.
===
Hello, Chandler.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
===
Margha.
Mar-klan.
===
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Yeah! Why donÂt you stick around. You can sit right there.
===
Well, that went well.
I think so.
===
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
===
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, IÂll let you have her.
===
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didnÂt I wouldnÂt have a shot?
Well I donÂt like to say it out loud, but, yeah! DonÂt feel bad man, we all have our strengths. YouÂre better with numbers and stuff.
===
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
All right, thatÂs it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
===
Oh I got it!!  Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Pheebs, run!
===
Before the snap!
After!!
===
Come on Phoebe, letÂs go! Come on, itÂs time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
ItÂs hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
===
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
What are you gonna do?
===
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, IÂll take care of the rest.
Okay.
===
Break!
Here you go!
===
No-no-no-no, the gameÂs not over, weÂre just switching teams.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that itÂs better if weÂre on the same team.
===
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
===
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Nice try.  See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
===
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? LetÂs play some ball, guys.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-IÂm not playing with this guy, now.
===
Okay, y'know what, letÂs just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 
===
Yes!!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didnÂt understand the question.
===
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
===
Hey! ItÂs 42-21!
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
===
IÂm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didnÂt know what to do.
 Thirty seconds left on the timer!
===
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
When theyÂre hungry enough, theyÂll come in.
===
Look out kids, heÂs coming! 
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
===
Have fun. Oh wait, no, donÂt! I forgot I am totally against that now.
What? Me having a job?
===
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Well, IÂm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
===
 Hey.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
===
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah,  oh, but oh...
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
===
Destiny.
Sure.
===
Yes.
All right.
===
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnÂt look very fulfilled.
Oh, thatÂs, thatÂs ah, one of the old ones, heÂs just taking it to the back.
===
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
===
So, what happens to the old guys?
Well, they go into the chipper.
===
Why, do I have a feeling thatÂs not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!! 
 Hey! Hey!! 
===
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
All right, IÂll take a box of the cream filled JesusÂs.
===
 IÂm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Look Rach, wasnÂt this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
===
Well, IÂm also sending out.... good thoughts.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, youÂve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
===
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear.... 
 Hey! I got great news!
===
Run, Joey! Run for your life! 
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
===
No.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
===
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Not a problem.
===
Thanks.
And now for the great news.
===
What, that wasnÂt the great news?
Only if you think itÂs better than this...  snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
===
Okay but thatÂs why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil itÂs Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Yeah, the ah, trees that donÂt fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
===
I-I think IÂm gonna look around a little bit more.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
===
Oh! Oh my God!
 Merry Christmas!!
===
Um-mm.
All right, give it back to me.  5 of hearts.
===
Wow. Joey,  how do you do it?
I canÂt tell you that, no.
===
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kidÂs pretzel at them.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
===
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
===
shots?
I donÂt know, Chandler is supposed to be passinÂ Âem around...
===
Oh my!!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
===
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
No, only for sex.
===
Uh-huh.
 Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! 
===
Oh, IÂm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Oh!!
===
ThatÂs okay.
 Can I talk to you for a second?!
===
Hey. 
Come on!! 
===
Why canÂt we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
I just got off the phone with my sister.
===
Ah, which, which one?
Mary-Angela.
===
Mary-Angela.
Yeah.
===
ItÂs gotta be the first one.
Really? ThatÂs great! You and my sister, sittinÂ in a tree.
===
 Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
===
IÂm here to see Mary-Angela.
You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, Âcause my Grandma doesnÂt know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
===
WhereÂs Mary-Angela?
SheÂs right in there. 
===
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
No! I did!
===
Well, itÂs, itÂs yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Of course! ItÂs her favorite.
===
So um, Mary-Angela, whatÂs your second favorite?
More of GrandmaÂs teramisu.
===
Would you just please....give me the receipt Âcause this is great. ItÂs top notch.
That dies with me.
===
So will I.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
===
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnÂt mean anything.
 Just do it.
===
 Hey!
Finally, I thought weÂd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. 
===
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.  Um, I just got out of a relationship and IÂm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
===
Ahhhh, youÂre not Mary-Angela.
No, IÂm Mary-Theresa.
===
No Joey! No Joey! DonÂt Joey! Joey!
WhatÂs goinÂ on?
===
ItÂs no big deal. Chandler was just kissinÂ me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
===
I wasnÂt sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, IÂm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
I say, punch him Joey.
===
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brotherÂs not going to punch me.  Are ya?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought youÂd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
===
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
No! No! No! No, IÂm not going to punch Chandler.
===
IÂll do it.
No you wonÂt. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, heÂs sorry. But,  youÂve got one more apology to make, all right, youÂve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
===
Okay, absolutely!
All right.
===
YouÂve got it. 
Cookie, now you can punch him!
===
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
All right, thatÂs it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime!  But, is he a big guy?
===
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud. 
 Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical? 
===
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. 
What? 
===
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. 
Who? 
===
I'll get you the Cliff Notes. 
The what? 
===
The abridgment. 
Oh, okay.  The what? 
===
Lovely, just lovely. 
Really? Thanks. 
===
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday. 
Excellent, I'll be there. 
===
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition. 
a dancing part. 
===
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?! 
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either. 
===
Well, can you dance at all? 
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.  
===
 What, what is that? 
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. 
===
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem. 
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
===
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. 
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? 
===
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.  
 The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
===
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.  
Whoa, I'm not done. 
===
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. 
Done. 
===
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' 
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' 
===
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island. 
So, does that mean the audition is off? 
===
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination. 
What?! 
===
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! 
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. 
===
Have fun. 
Bye.  
===
No, no, no. What was that? 
I know, it was the best I could get out of them. 
===
Well, people! 
People, people, people. 
===
Hey.
 Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
===
Okay.
Cool.
===
ItÂs not a date, okay. IÂm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know youÂll probably be hungry after the sex.
===
 Hey.
Hey.
===
Do you have any ice?
Check the freezer. If thereÂs none in there, then weÂre probably out. Are you just getting in from work? ItÂs late.
===
How often do you read it?
HavenÂt you ever read the same book over and over again?
===
All right.
Okay.
===
Okay.
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
===
Yeah.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
===
Your liking it, huh?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned JoÂs manuscript. I donÂt see how he could ever forgive her.
===
No, actually LaurieÂs a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
===
Hey.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
===
 Hey!
Hey!  HowÂs it going?
===
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Oooh, the next partÂs the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
===
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on youÂre gonna ruin it!
All right IÂll talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
===
Hmmm, thatÂs very cool.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, makeÂs blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
===
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though sheÂs still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
===
Um-hmm.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
===
No. She doesnÂt die.
Then why would you say that?!
===
What?
Beth is really, really sick.
===
Awwww.
JoÂs there, but I donÂt think thereÂs anything she could do.
===
Joey?
Yeah.
===
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
 Okay.
===
 ÂCause every time I see your face, I canÂt help but fall from grace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good.
===
 All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. IÂd like know whether thatÂs several big fish or just one big fish.
 So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
===
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
 Ah, anything we might of heard of?
===
Ah, yeah, umm.  Home is never far away..
 Home is Home Star stew.
===
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. 
 Wow, that was kinda brutal.
===
WhereÂs Chandler?
Ah, he canÂt make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh! 
===
run on a barge!
 Hey.
===
Hey.
Is ah, is Chandler around?
===
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Oooh.
===
Yeah, Ginger something.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasnÂt something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
===
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,  Âthe movie star.Â
Aww, man. ThatÂs the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out heÂs my roommate, sheÂs gonna tell him what I did.
===
Well, what did you do?
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I canÂt, I canÂt tell you that, itÂs like the most awful, horrible thing IÂve ever done my whole life.
===
Y'know what, donÂt tell us. WeÂll just wait until Chandler gets home,  because itÂll be more fun that way.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her DadÂs cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
===
You gave her food poisoning!?
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
===
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably shouldÂve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
===
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I ran!!
===
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnÂt have, but it did. I mean I like her, I donÂt want to stop seeing her, but every so often itÂs like ÂHey, y'know what, whereÂs your leg?Â I mean IÂm the smallest person in the world arenÂt I? IÂm the smallest person in the world.
 Morning.
===
 Actually heÂs the smallest person in the world.
 Heard about the leg burninÂ huh?
===
It came up.
Listen, I ah, I know itÂs a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
===
Sorry, Pheebs.
Yeah. You okay?
===
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-lifeÂs gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Yeah.
===
 Well hello!
Where have you been?
===
I wonÂt give you anything, but youÂll owe me 2.95.
Done.
===
Hold on.
So Pheebs whatÂs this guy like?
===
Well, if you donÂt have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
===
Yeah! You wanna come?
Yeah!
===
Uh-oh.
Uh, y'know what, weÂre having second thoughts about our copying needs. And weÂll need a little more time to think about it.
===
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Both of us? 
===
Relax. ItÂs just IssacÂs D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
WeÂll be there.
===
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Uh, 10:30.
===
What time is it now?
4:30.
===
Yeah all right, so weÂll hang out.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
===
Yes. Vividly.
She was kidding about that right?
===
Yeah, I-I-I think so.  Yeah, I-I think so...
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
===
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Dude, I donÂt know.
===
She was kidding.
Yeah.
===
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you donÂt want to be doing something and then look up and see something you donÂt want to be seeing.
===
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... 
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  y'know each would,  y'know  be?
===
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Yeah, I guess, but whatÂs like heads and whatÂs tails?
===
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
===
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, heÂs just really believes in that.
===
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Yeah. We figured when we couldnÂt find you, youÂd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
===
What?! Look, weÂre trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Look, Ross look, IÂm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thatÂs gonna get you in trouble.
===
HeÂs right. NobodyÂs gonna benefit, and youÂre just gonna hurt her.
Yeah, and there wonÂt be a relationship left to rebuild.
===
Yeah, okay. 
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnÂt find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?
===
What trail?
 The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!
===
Yeah, well I donÂt think you can make that statement, unless youÂve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, thatÂs all. I mean, come on, itÂs just a little wax.
===
Oh, thatÂs mature.
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
===
She was not good. Not good.
She was nothing compared to you.
===
 What, what are you doing? You canÂt go out there.
Why not?!  IÂm hungry.
===
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Yeah, weÂll be fine.
===
What?
Well y'know, IÂve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a Âtake noticeÂ walk.
===
TheyÂve been quiet for a long time.
Maybe she killed him?
===
 Is that your new walk?
 No, I really have to pee.
===
This is the 
I see the comics?
===
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
===
Why? What happened now?
Well Ross was hanginÂ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
===
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
===
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? HeÂs the one who slept with someone else. 
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
===
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
I had the same dream!
===
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. 
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
===
Y'know what maybe itÂs gonna be okay, I mean itÂs been a week.
Yeah, I mean itÂs never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
===
Oh, itÂs okay. 
Rach, itÂs, itÂs ah, itÂs not that we donÂt want to, really.  Are we talking models in their underwear?
===
And heels.
  Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
===
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Oh yeah.
===
 Oh my God!
YouÂre smoking again?!
===
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think?  Two days of darts, itÂll be great!
ItÂll be great for next weekend.
===
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
ItÂll be great for next weekend. I mean,  itÂll be grrreat.
===
Y'know what, I can stay, IÂm gonna stay. ÂCause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmotherÂs cab, but y'know what, IÂll stay.
===
 Well heÂs probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
What? Mine arenÂt tinted.
===
Oh, come on, thereÂs a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Oh, now I have to go!!
===
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
WhatÂs going on?
===
Damn!  The tailpipeÂs not hot enough to light this!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
===
So, if youÂre parents hadnÂt got divorced, youÂd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
===
What?!
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
===
Please!!
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
===
No, not getting my bra!
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
===
 Okay, there.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
===
Okay, now letÂs decide who has the nicest ass.
 And there you go!
===
So the going for help went well?
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
===
 WhatÂs ÂplehÂ?
ThatÂs ÂhelpÂ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
===
Oh, itÂs Ross on one of his drives!
Hey!!
===
Oh, this is horrible, itÂs just horrible.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
===
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
No, I wasnÂt gonna ask you that, no.
===
Here we go again.
I-I canÂt handle this, you guys.
===
Really Joey?
 What?
===
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!  Look what youÂre doing to Chandler!!   Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay?  You donÂt, all right you donÂt have to love each other, okay? You donÂt, you donÂt even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
===
Okay. Good, all right, letÂs get back in the car, Âcause itÂs freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? WhoÂs going with who?
===
Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, IÂm, you, you planned this all out, and I donÂt want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
===
 WhatÂs so funny?
Oh, nothing, no. ItÂs an acting exercise, IÂm practising my fake laugh.
===
Oh. 
What-whatÂs so funny?
===
Exactly, itÂll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
===
No-no, oh, IÂm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking itÂs tongue down my little brotherÂs throat! 
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
===
But, I mean, do you think heÂs gonna enjoy it when heÂs up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank,  and it-itÂs not fair to the babies, and y'know what, itÂs not good home economics.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
===
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then heÂs gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I canÂt.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
No-no-no-no-no. 
===
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
No.
===
Okay, IÂm gonna go get Frank. 
So, weÂre walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, ÂHey, letÂs go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,Â remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, ÂNah, letÂs just hang out at your place.Â Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. 
===
All weÂre saying is donÂt rush into anything.
Yeah, come on, think about it. YouÂre 18, okay, sheÂs 44, when youÂre 36, sheÂs gonna be 88.
===
What, you donÂt think I know that?
Look, the point is, thereÂs a lot of women out there you havenÂt even had sex with yet!
===
Okay, but isnÂt sex better when itÂs with one person that you really, really care about.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
===
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what IÂve got with Alice.
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
===
Yeah, yeah.
 Why canÂt I find that?
===
DonÂt ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well, I want it!
===
You can have it!
I donÂt know, maybe I canÂt. I mean, maybe thereÂs something wrong with me.
===
ItÂs out there man! IÂve seen it! I got it!!
Then you hold on to it!!
===
All right, man!!
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! 
===
 YouÂre FrankÂs best man?!
I couldnÂt help it, there love is so pure.
===
Hi!!
Hey!
===
CigaretteÂs donÂt control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. 
 JoeyÂs your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday.  And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants. 
===
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
 Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! 
===
Joe. HowÂs it going?
Good.  Hey.
===
Hi.
Oh, so youÂre playing Adrienne, huh?
===
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. IÂm Joey Tribianni.
===
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van MurrayÂs work. SheÂs so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
===
No, thatÂs not it. So, youÂre a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Hey, IÂve done plays before. IÂm a serious actor.
===
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! YouÂre-youÂre-youÂre the guy that doesnÂt know how to pour milk!!
pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldnÂt. Now, see, thatÂs acting.
===
 Hello.
Hey!
===
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
===
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
===
ThatÂs not a state Joe.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
===
Happy?! Is that what IÂm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why donÂt you tell me what youÂre supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell canÂt figure it out! I talk to you and nothinÂ. You look at me, and itÂs nothinÂ.  Nothing.
===
Peel the onion. First of all, heÂs good looking.
Yeah.
===
I think my characterÂs gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, itÂs says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I donÂt know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youÂre a bitch.
===
It doesnÂt say that in the script.
It does in mine!
===
 I wasnÂt doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks sheÂs like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
===
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ÂOh, IÂm so talented.Â and ÂOh, IÂm so pretty,Â and ÂOoh, I smell so good.Â
===
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
===
IÂm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, youÂre out of your mind.
===
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youÂd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
===
Happy?! Is that what IÂm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why donÂt you tell me what youÂre supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell canÂt figure it out! I talk to you and itÂs nothinÂ. You look at me, and nothinÂ.  Nothing.
===
Well, that was ah...
Better?
===
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. GÂnight.
Ah, Kate? 
===
Yeah?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
===
 IÂm probably gonna need those. Huh? 
Hey, listen you ah....
===
Hmm?
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
===
So umm, IÂll see you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
===
Wait a minute, wait. YouÂre telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnÂt want you back?!
Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what itÂs like to be you?
===
Wow, youÂre really crazy about her, huh?
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when weÂre on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and itÂs like somebodyÂs ripping out my heart!
===
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
===
Morning.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
===
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! 
 And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
===
Hi, oh, IÂm Lauren, KateÂs understudy.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
===
I know! I-IÂm a big fan of yours.
 What?!
===
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on 
Get out of here, really?!
===
Absolutely!
Yeah? 
===
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
They gave me the shaft all right.
===
 Oh, youÂre so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Well Ahh,  yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
===
Cool! I-IÂll see you then.
All right.
===
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater youÂre dating.
Hey, IÂm not interested in her sweater! ItÂs whatÂs underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who IÂm going out with?
===
I donÂt care. Why, do you want me to care?
Do you want me to want you to care?
===
Do you?
What?
===
I canÂt believe we go on in, in a week.
Hey, itÂs gonna be all right.
===
 Hey! So since weÂre getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
What?
===
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
===
Oh, okay.
Okay. 
===
IÂll see you tomorrow. 
Okay.
===
GÂnight. 
 Ah, are you okay?
===
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
I donÂt know.
===
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
How do you mean?
===
Well, AdrianÂs looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor canÂt just kiss her, heÂs gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
===
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
===
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
===
Yeah, thatÂs pretty much what I had in mind.
Yeah.
===
Hi.
 Hey. 
===
Hi.
Hey.
===
ItÂs a little early to be drinkinÂ.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
===
YouÂre kidding?! ThatÂs great!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the  love making...
===
Oh my.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming Âcause, Âcause her eyes keep going like this. 
===
Hi.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
===
About what?
Y'know, about what happened with us.
===
Nooo. And thereÂs really no reason he should find out, so ah letÂs not make a big deal about it, okay?
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you canÂt tell me last night didnÂt mean something to you. I-I was there, youÂre not that good an actress.
===
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. ThatÂs all it was. Joey, IÂm-IÂm sorry you feel bad, but havenÂt you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.
===
Hi, Lauren.
Hi, Lauren.
===
Are you all right?
 Oh my.
===
 Hey.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
===
Yeah. 
Saw a girl with that vest.
===
 While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents.  Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys wonÂt live to see the fourth of July.  Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
 Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ÂCause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
===
Okay, so I guess thatÂs about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
 Hey!!
===
Hey!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
===
Okay.  ItÂs a chicken.
ItÂs cute, huh?
===
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lotÂs and lotÂs of love.
Oh, well no problem there. 
===
Okay, but this is the last time.  With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Hey.
===
Hey.
HowÂs she doing?
===
She?
Well yeah, donÂt-donÂt you think itÂs a she?
===
I donÂt know.  I canÂt tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, IÂm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
===
Excuse me?
What?
===
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Hey! Who was up from 2 oÂclock this morning until 5 oÂclock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
===
You donÂt think I get up when you get up?
Ohhh, here it comes.
===
Yes, here it comes! IÂm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I donÂt think so mister!
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
===
And you donÂt think taking care of our chick is work?
ThatÂs not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
===
I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, weÂve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
I donÂt know, maybe we werenÂt ready to have a chick.
===
IÂll take her back tomorrow.
Do you think weÂll get our three bucks back?
===
 Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think?  This blue suit, or this brown one?
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
===
I know. See, yes. ThatÂs Yasmine Bleeth, sheÂs a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
 Hey!
===
If they canÂt find a home for her, they kill her! And IÂm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, good, good, good, Âcause, good, Âcause I was kinda having second thoughts too. 
===
Okay. And itÂs not just chicks y'know? ItÂs all kinds of other animals!
ThatÂs horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
===
Having a swim.
What about the chick?
===
Chicks donÂt swim.
Are you sure?
===
I donÂt know. Should we try it?
Sure.
===
See, I told you they donÂt swim. 
 Wait. Give him a minute.
===
Ye-e-es!!
 Hey.
===
Hey. 
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
===
I need two. IÂm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
===
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, soÂ
But you said one.
===
I meant, me plus one!
Okay.  Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
===
All right, IÂll see you tonight.
Okay.
===
Okay, I need a date! 
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
===
Oh!
 And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
===
Yeah, and I donÂt have any cologne.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
===
ThereÂs our star!
So, so, whatÂd ya think?
===
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
I-I wasnÂt in that.
===
I know.
 Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
===
So thatÂs the girl you like.
Yeah.
===
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous! 
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
===
How do you do.  Ooh, you two girls were outstanding!  Did they have representation?
No, they-they werenÂt in the play.
===
 Here we go people!  Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-laÂ Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
===
Fabulous.
Listen, drama critics theyÂre nothing but, but people who couldnÂt make it as actors. You know what you should do?
===
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Oh, classy. 
===
Yep! I sure know how to pick Âem, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
===
Really. What?
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. WeÂll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
===
Why the Post?
Oh, you didnÂt see the Post?
===
No. You?
No. Why?
===
 So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Oh, absolutely! YouÂre talented and youÂre good looking.
===
Oh, youÂre sweet and cute.
I know! ThatÂs why they trashed me!
===
What?
I, I donÂt get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
===
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Kate, do you even like me?
===
Of course I do.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
===
I donÂt know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guyÂ Why canÂt I just pick someone like you?
Thanks.
===
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, youÂre just so, youÂre so, soÂ 
 Okay. Okay, okay, hey.  There we go, letÂs get your feet up there.  Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams.  IÂm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
===
No, no, IÂm fine, and yÂknow why? ÂCause of all the riboflavin.
 Hey!
===
Hey! DidnÂt you have that outfit on last night?
Yeah! I stayed at KateÂs, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
===
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now weÂre like totally crazy about each other!
===
Joey, you had the night! 
What?
===
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
You-you think?
===
Did you like learn about her family?
Two brothers, one died!
===
Yes!!
Yeah?!
===
 Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
   WhereÂs Kate?
===
 She got a job in L.A.
 What?!
===
IÂve been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been?  Where have you been? Vic?!
Oh, ahh, go to the window. IÂm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
===
 What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp? 
  When is she leaving?
===
 Tonight. What are you doing?
 IÂm coming up!
===
Joey!
Hey!
===
IÂm soo glad I caught you, I couldnÂt find you before.
Wh-wh-whatÂs going on? Wh-whatÂs this about L.A.?
===
They still want me for 
But, but wh-what about us?
===
Last night was wonderful. But I-I canÂt stay here just for you.
Well, so, stay for the museums! 
===
Joey, onstage!
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, IÂll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
===
Vic! Vic! 
 In a minute!!
===
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is.  Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick Âcause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, youÂve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And soÂ IÂm gonna get on this spaceship,  and IÂm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, youÂll be long gone. But I wonÂt have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, IÂm gonna want to meet her. 
===
 Hey.
Hey.
===
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
 What was it?
===
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. 
Whoa!!!
===
Well what is it? Is it a mole? 
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
===
Ahhh.
Yeah, right.
===
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
===
 Hey guys!
Hey.
===
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Well what is it?!
===
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
===
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
===
Really?!
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
===
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
===
 Uh.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
===
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo 
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
===
Yeah.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
===
Jason is not a sissy!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
===
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
===
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
===
 Hey Pete.
Hi, how ya doing?
===
So, what do you thing the good news is?
 Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design.  Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
===
 Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  ThatÂs supposed to be a duck right? ÂCause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Yeah, yeah. HeÂs got a, heÂs got a really bad cough, and our vet, he canÂt do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
===
HowÂd it go with Pete?!
Tell us!
===
ItÂs me, IÂve been sleeping with your wife.
 So youÂre the gynaecologist?
===
 Oh.
And itÂs not fake, itÂs totally brutal.
===
Huh, whatÂs fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
===
I gotta tell ya, I think itÂs okay to be that guy.
Yeah, maybe itÂs like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.  
===
Okay, can we please go eat?
Yeah. What are we getting?
===
All right so, Chandler, from now on, donÂt give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, donÂt turn your back to him.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
===
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
 Hey, the fightÂs starting!
===
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, itÂs gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow IÂm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
 FightÂs over!
===
Oh, I canÂt watch this. 
Check it out, heÂs winning!  PeteÂs winning!
===
Really?!
No-o-o!!
===
 I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
===
Joey, she was listing the countries sheÂs done it in.
Well, I think we all learned something.
===
Y'know what that means?
That youÂre actually 50?
===
So great! Okay! Tomorrow weÂre gonna drive out to Montauk.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
===
Well IÂd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
 Hey!
===
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
No, itÂs just my luggage.
===
Hey!!
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
===
Hey!
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
===
What?!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
===
What are you crazy?!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, itÂs like a law!
===
Bored and bored!
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
===
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
What?
===
Okay.
Fan out! Fan out!
===
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
 OH YES!!!!!
===
Strip Happy Days Game?
Yeah, well, I couldnÂt find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
===
 Okay, your band is playing at ArnoldÂs, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get JoeyÂs boxers!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
===
Come on, take Âem off!!
Actually, y'know itÂs kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
===
What are you guys doing?!
WeÂre playing Strip Happy Days Game!
===
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
What?!
===
Well! Good night.  IÂm going upstairs.
GÂnight.
===
Hey, itÂll grow back, right? And she-sheÂs really fun, and sheÂs cool, and-and IÂm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and IÂm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesnÂt work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, youÂre doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
===
Yeah.
Right, and you go with Rachel, BonnieÂs free tonight?
===
  Hi there. 
 ...and he couldnÂt let it go, and... I donÂt really know what happened with that either. 
===
Oh, my new Mom, who-whoÂs a big, fat abandoner! 
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! DonÂt you wanna stay here and talk about it?
===
IÂve got canned goods.
 Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
===
 Ow!! Ow!!!
 What?! What?!! What is it?!
===
ItÂs like two miles!
Yeah, and IÂm a little tired from digging the hole.
===
WeÂve got to do something!
Well, thereÂs really only one thing you can do.
===
What?! What is it?!
YouÂre gonna have to pee on it.
===
Well forget it! It doesnÂt hurt that  
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
===
Me too!!
Me too.
===
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  ÂIf you accept full responsibility...Â  Full responsibility! Â...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do.  Does it?!!Â
No?
===
 Yeah, I know. I mean, no, youÂre right. Yeah I guess IÂll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Sure, itÂs hard to forget! But that doesnÂt mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
===
What the hell happened on that beach?!
ItÂs between us and the sea, Ross!
===
My God, you canÂt even look at me! Can you?
Nope.
===
 Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
NO!!!
===
What happened? Joey?
All right.  
===
 TheyÂll never understand!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! ItÂs eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
===
I was in too much pain.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
===
 Ewwww!!
ThatÂs right I stepped up! SheÂs my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, IÂd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnÂt. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
===
 Joey kept screaming at me, ÂDo it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!Â Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
 ThatÂs Âcause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
===
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
===
You donÂt turn and slide, you throw it out! IÂm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Look, weÂre not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
===
All right, how about we, how Âbout we sell it.
All right. But, youÂre gonna have to tell them. 
===
IÂm reading your ad.
Looks good, uh?
===
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
===
All right look, IÂm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
===
 Nooo.
Oh. What do you do?
===
Nothing. Nothing.
What? WhatÂs wrong?
===
No Dr. Skeptismo! IÂm sure. First of all, okay, thereÂs the feeling.  Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  My MotherÂs favourite fish is Orange Roughy...  Cats....like....fish!   Hi, Mommy.  Oh, I havenÂt seen this smile in 17 years!
 Dude, PhoebeÂs mom has got a huge peni...
===
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I donÂt think any of them are gonna work out.
===
Wow! ThatÂs ah, thatÂs pretty nice!
Pretty nice?
===
WeÂre not throwing it away! I built that canoe! 
 Good for you!!
===
You guys, thereÂs a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
 Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
===
Hey!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
===
Yeah?
 HowÂs that going?
===
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
ThatÂs so sweet.  IÂm gonna get some coffee. 
===
What?!
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnÂt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny Âtil I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
===
No, you, you canÂt fit in that thing. ThatÂs not deep enough.
Oh yeah?  If I canÂt, IÂll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
===
All right, you have yourself a deal. 
Okay.  See?! I told ya! 
===
OH MY GOD!!!
 WHAT?!! 
===
Are you all right?!
Yeah...
===
 What happened?!!
 Awww, man! He promised he wouldnÂt take the chairs!!
===
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnÂt think big enough to fit a grown man!
===
SoÂYou got in 
I was tryinÂ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what IÂm gonna do?
===
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
 Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
===
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
ThatÂs a good call. Right.
===
Oh! Y'know, IÂve got an extra futon.
Dude, you donÂt have to brag! We got nothing here!!
===
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped! 
===
 Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Uhhhh. 
===
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? 
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
===
So, hereÂs somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
He cut off his ear.
===
He painted that. 
Wow! ThatÂs pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear Âcause he sucked. What else you got in there?
===
LetÂs see, ahhhÂ Where does the Pope live?
In the woods. No wait-wait, thatÂs the joke answer.
===
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? IÂm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess thereÂs a few things you donÂt get from book learninÂ.
===
Well ah, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
===
 I love you. 
Wh-whatÂs going on?
===
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. 
IÂm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
===
ThatÂs easy for you to say, you werenÂt almost just killed.
All right thatÂs it, school is in session! 
===
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that heÂd better come up here and apologize. IÂll see you later. 
===
What a minute, what did he say?
He said that he wasnÂt gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what heÂs gonna do is have you evictedÂIÂll see you later.
===
I told you not to go down there!
Well he made Rachel cry!
===
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youÂve never sucked before!
All right! IÂll try! But if I canÂt, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
===
Go!!
All right, all right, all right.  I mean IÂll have to check with him first, but IÂll think heÂll be cool with it. 
===
His dancing partner?!
Yeah, thereÂs this superintendentÂs dance, the Super Ball. I donÂt know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that heÂs a crush on.
===
Well, why doesnÂt he practice with a girl?
Well, heÂs too shy, he doesnÂt thing heÂs good enough to dance with girls yet.
===
YouÂre a genius!
Aww, man, now we wonÂt be bank buddies!
===
Thank you, Joey.
No-no, thank you.
===
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. 
===
 What was that?
What?
===
You just did a little dancy thing.
No I didnÂt.
===
You are soo enjoying this.
No, IÂm not! And it wasnÂt a hop it was a pademarie. 
===
into this!
All right, well maybe IÂm enjoying it a little bit. I mean IÂm getting pretty good at it.
===
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isnÂt some kind of like girly dance. All right, itÂs like a sport, itÂs manly!
===
All right, then show me some manly moves.
All right.
===
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
What?!
===
YeahÂ Bunny-rabbit.
 So you ah, ready for our last practice?
===
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date.  Oh, and there he is now.
Hey!
===
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. 
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
===
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
===
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. 
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
===
Really?!
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
===
99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
 Hey!
===
Hey!
Hey guys.  Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
===
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
It's 4:30.
===
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
===
You-you do?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
===
Yeah. Right.
Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
===
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Is she great or what?
===
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. 
 I'll be right back.  What was that?
===
What?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
===
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
===
I am pretending.
Well then, do it better!
===
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
===
Here you go.
Great! All right, so IÂll call you later.
===
 Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. WeÂre going out tonight.
===
GoinÂ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnÂt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy. IÂm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
===
 What?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! 
===
Wait! YouÂre going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
===
Well, IÂm upsetÂfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. 
What is the big deal? ItÂs not like weÂre exclusive.
===
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that sheÂs-sheÂs smart, and funny, and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
===
All right look, I think itÂs time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
WhoÂs Elaine?
===
I like it in the stern.  Âof the boat.   Hello.
 Hey, itÂs me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
===
What happened?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that IÂll be there as soon as I can.
===
Why canÂt you tell her?
ÂCause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about toÂ
===
Joey! Joey!!
Yeah?
===
I thought your time ran out.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of moreÂ
===
 Oh the phone! The phoneÂs making sounds!  Hello!
 Hey dude, itÂs me.
===
Hey itÂs Joey!
Listen uh, IÂm really sorry, it looks like IÂm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnÂt there!
===
What?
Yeah, it mustÂve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
===
Okay.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
===
Hang on buddy! 
 Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
===
I sure did.
Why?
===
Well, I just thought itÂd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, youÂre amazing.
===
is amazing. 
 A TV as if it appears from nowhere! ThatÂs the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
===
Well, yÂknow IÂm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
===
Oh, I donÂt know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, IÂm gonna do that.
===
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think IÂm gonna see how things go with Kathy. SheÂs pretty cool.
===
Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
===
Could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.
===
Consider Casey.
YÂknow what I think? I think somebodyÂs got a little crush on Casey. How Âbout I fix you two up? What do you think?
===
Hey!
Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
===
Is that a real thing?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
===
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
WhatÂs up?
===
ItÂs-itÂs about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
You do?
===
Yeah.
Well, youÂre timing couldnÂt be better. SheÂs not my girlfriend anymore.
===
What?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
===
Oh uh, when?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thatÂs why I let people watch.
===
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Well, IÂve been better. But, IÂm all right. So you like her huh?
===
Yes, but I-I uh, donÂt have too.
No-no-no, no itÂs uh, itÂs okay.
===
Yeah?
Yeah. You know why? ÂCause you came to me first.
===
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youÂre work cut out for you. ÂCause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that sheÂs into some other guy. SoÂ
===
See uh, thatÂs-thatÂs actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
===
ItÂs me. IÂm the other guy.
What?
===
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another andÂ
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
===
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
What?!! ThatÂs even worse!!
===
How is that worse?!
I donÂt know! But itÂs the same!
===
Look, IÂm sorry! But thereÂs nothing I can do, I think IÂm in love with her!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
===
YouÂre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-youÂre-youÂre so far past the line, that you-you canÂt even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
===
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, yÂknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and thereÂs a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that IÂm not gonna eat! You know why?!
===
Probably becauseÂ
Because itÂs all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And IÂm not happy about you either.  Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. 
===
 Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
All right!
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
What are you doing?
IÂm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
===
Everything? Even the TV?
No! IÂm putting that in my room.
===
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but donÂt you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
===
ThatÂs a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Five years. 
===
YouÂve sentenced him?!
Hey! DonÂt do the crime if you canÂt do the time.
===
Joey, the guyÂs your best friend.
my best friend. Anyway, I donÂt know why youÂre pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, thereÂs a spot open.
===
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah!
===
Wow! IÂm honored! And yÂknow what IÂm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
What?
===
IÂm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
All right. But if you werenÂt my best friend.
===
I walk into a room and he wonÂt even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I
 Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
===
Hey Joe.
 
===
Hey! IÂm sorry! ThatÂ where are you going?
My folks.
===
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
I donÂt know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
===
What?!
Yeah, yÂknow at first I thought we could talk about this yÂknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I donÂt think IÂ
===
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that IÂll stop seeing her?
Look, itÂs not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I donÂt want to live with some one who doesnÂt know what it is to be a friend. So, IÂll see ya. 
===
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Yeah! You did! And thatÂs why IÂm leaving.
===
What?
Yeah! But if wouldÂve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnÂt have worried about it so much! See you around!
===
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?
WeÂve got a box. 
===
Yeah.
 WhatÂs twisted?
===
Me going out with RichardÂs son.
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
===
Is he okay in there?
HeÂs fine!
===
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Chandler?
===
And Joey.
Hey!
===
Umm, well, heÂsÂ
HeÂs doinÂ some thinkinÂ!
===
What happened? What happened?!
You kissed my girlfriend!
===
Gotcha! 
That doesnÂt sound like thinking to me!
===
Sorry!
YÂknow I donÂt think you should be talking at all in there! I think youÂve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
===
You canÂt tell, but IÂm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnÂt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youÂre just an idiot in a box!
===
YouÂre right, and IÂm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wonÂt say another word tonight.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
===
Absolutely!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?  Okay.
===
 Oh.
Hey.
===
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I amÂ
ThatÂs okay. ChandlerÂs the one IÂm mad at.
===
Well, IÂm still sorry. Is he here?
In the box.
===
What?!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there!  Get out of there!
===
So?
Yeah, weÂre gonna be fine! Get out!
===
Yeah?
Yeah, you did some real good thinkinÂ in there.
===
HeÂs taking her purse!
Uhh, thatÂs not them. IÂm gonna go call the police.
===
Yeah, itÂs for our catering business!
I think I know that girl.
===
And also, we donÂt know what to do with this. 
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
===
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
===
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
===
Oh man! I am so excitedÂI may vomit!
Will you calm down, heÂs just a human guy.
===
Look you donÂt understand, Gandolf is amazing. YÂknow youÂre never know whatÂs gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! 
Really?!
===
like last time.
All right, IÂll see you guys.
===
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
I have an audition, but IÂll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
===
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Okay. 
===
ItÂs Gandolf, and heÂs not coming.
So youÂve been sittinÂ around here all morninÂ?
===
I canÂt believe he didnÂt come!
So what if he didnÂt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
===
Yeah! WeÂd meet, weÂd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Well, we could do that! 
===
ThereÂs other stuff too.
WeÂll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
===
Yeah!
Yeah!
===
Yeah!!
Yeah!! 
===
ItÂs not like we donÂt know how to party!!
Yeah! All right? LetÂs go!
===
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Yeah!!!
===
Okay.
So, weÂre having fun, right?
===
Yeah.
We donÂt need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, weÂll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
===
Actually, me too.
Are you serious?!
===
Yeah.
Thank God! IÂm exhausted!
===
So you guys want coffees?
Yeah, but uh, I donÂt want to be up too late, so uh, IÂll have a decaf. 
===
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
I canÂt hear a word youÂre saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
===
How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.
===
YÂknow what? WeÂre not sad, weÂre not sad, weÂre just not 21 anymore. YÂknow? IÂm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah!
===
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
WeÂre 29, weÂre not women.
===
How can she be great if sheÂs from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldÂve killed in Albany.
Done! I did it! Heh, whoÂs stupid now? 
===
Well, believe me, itÂs been a long time since IÂve been flung.
Well, I know what IÂm giving you for Christmas.
===
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. 
Ohhh!
===
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whoÂs boss.
Hey, Mon! IÂm not doing anything, why donÂt you fire me?
===
ThatÂs a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Good enough to get fired.
===
Hey! You guys, IÂm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Yes!
===
I know but itÂs so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
===
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! TheyÂre buying me drinks! TheyÂre giving me stuff!  Knicks tonight?
Sure! Where are the seats?
===
ItÂs a big company, I donÂtÂif youÂIÂ
robots?
===
 All right, IÂm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
===
You want a problem? IÂll give you a problem!
Oh, what are you gonna do? YouÂre gonna fire me?
===
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yÂknow? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasÂif she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasnÂt kidding, sheÂs not fun, sheÂs stupid, and kind of a racist.
 Hey!
===
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
 Damn! 
===
Hey.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chefÂs jacket? 
===
They baked it. I canÂt take this anymore. IÂm gonna call a meeting tonight, IÂm gonna fire you tonight.
You got it! Oh-oh! 
===
What are you doing?!
ItÂs still a tiny bit on fire there.
===
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yeah. Listen uh, IÂd prefer it if you didnÂt call me Joey. Since I donÂt know anyone here, I thought itÂd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
===
 Hey, dragon! HereÂs your tips from Monday and Tuesday. 
 ThereÂs like-thereÂs like 300 bucks in this one!
===
What the hell happened?!
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! ItÂs been a long time since I hadÂ  327 + 238 dollars!"
===
Joey, we had a deal. That-thatÂs why youÂre here! IÂve got to fire you!
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You donÂt fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyÂll start listening to all the nice things IÂve been saying about you.
===
What kinda things have you been saying?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
===
 IÂm a good person. And IÂm a good chef, and I donÂt deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! YÂknow what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do isÂ
 Hey! Chef Geller! YÂknow that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
===
You do?
You bet I do! I just ah, wasnÂt listening then, thatÂs all.
===
Well if you want a problem? IÂll give you a problem!
What are you gonna do? YouÂre gonna fire me?
===
Thanks.
Yep! Looks like itÂs gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
===
Enough!
 Lean-lean-lean!
===
So what job did you get Joe?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
===
Well, how can you be a tour guide, donÂt you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
No, not really. They give you all the information, itÂs uh, itÂs like memorizing a script.  "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
===
Uh actually Joey, itÂs the Cretasous period.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
===
Yeah
YouÂre really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
===
Ewww! And "Oh no!" ItÂsÂthey just want me to be the surrogate. ItÂs her-itÂs her egg and her sperm, and IÂm-IÂm just the oven, itÂs totally their bun. 
Huh.
===
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, weÂll be supportive like crazy.
===
IsnÂt the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here,  we have a large foot.  Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller.  Everyone wave ÂHiÂ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.  Okay, moving right along. Come on.
===
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I didnÂt know he had a nickname.
===
Oh, he wonÂt sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Well, how-how come?
===
ThatÂs just the way it is.
ThatÂs crazy.
===
 Hey, uh, IÂm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
ItÂs no big deal. Hey, yÂknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?
===
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Look, Ross, really itÂs-itÂs no big deal. YÂknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we canÂt be friends at work, then so be it. YÂknow, hey I understand. YÂknow? Hey, when IÂm in a play and youÂre in the audience, I donÂt talk to you, right? So itÂs yÂknow, itÂs uh, itÂs cool. IÂll see you tomorrow. 
===
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but IÂm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. IÂm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if heÂll sit with me.
 I will sit with you Dr. Geller. 
===
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yÂknow what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  IÂm Ross! IÂm divorced, and I have a kid!
 IÂm Joey! IÂm an actor! I donÂt know squat about dinosaurs!
===
All right, there you go!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
===
You!
ItÂs the chick! SheÂsÂgoing through some changes.
===
Oh, good luck.
Good luck.  And IÂm still right!
===
What?
SheÂs mad because I know todayÂs her laundry day and that means sheÂs wearing her old lady underpants.
===
can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Yeah, whatÂs that about?
===
Yeah.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
===
How many guesses do you get?
Six.
===
Challenge excepted.
All right, weÂll start withÂapples.
===
Yes!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
===
Okay, well, we won that one.
Okay, the last thingÂ
===
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! 
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
===
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Serious?
===
Are you scared?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
===
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Huh.
===
I know! I know, itÂs such a huge, life-altering thing.
I know.
===
What is MonicaÂs biggest pet peeve?
Animals dressed as humans.
===
That is correct.
 The Irish gig guy?!
===
Gentlemen, youÂre pick.
ItÂs All Relative.
===
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
 Nana?
===
She has a real name.
 Althea!
===
Althea?! What are you doing?! 
I took a shot.
===
Oooohh thatÂs interesting.
Hey, no way, that roosterÂs family!
===
Throw in the duck too!
What do you have against the duck?! He doesnÂt make any noise!
===
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Look, we are not gonnaÂ
===
 All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
 Dah!! 
===
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Oooooh!
===
All right, gentlemen, youÂre up first.
Okay.
===
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsÂstop it Ânow. What was MonicaÂs nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Big fat goalie.
===
Fancy.
Guest.
===
Two secondsÂ
Uhh, 11!
===
Oh my God.
YES!!!
===
You canÂt just call MonicaÂs room.
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, IÂm sight of the room and I called it.
===
Man, I feel like IÂm coming down with something.
What?
===
Hey!
HeyÂooh Pheebs, are they in there?
===
All right, IÂm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
===
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
You canÂt just ignore the bet! ItÂs a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
===
YÂknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Hey, donÂt get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
===
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
But it is our apartment!
===
What?! What-what is it?!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
===
That sounds great!
 Hey! 
===
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You canÂt eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
 ThereÂs gravy?
===
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut up here.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
IÂm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyÂre gonna go to their cast parties and heÂs gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itÂll be like, "So whereÂs your boyfriend, whatÂs-his-name, Chester?" And sheÂll go, "No-no-no, itÂs Chandler." And heÂll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
 That-that is a good trick.
===
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Chandler, look theyÂre actors. TheyÂre there to do a job, just Âcause they work together, doesnÂt mean theyÂre gonna get together. I mean just Âcause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnÂt mean itÂs gonna happen with them.
===
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
===
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
===
Oh yeah!
Well okay, so then youÂre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as itÂs hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. ItÂs when the heat goes away, thatÂs when youÂre in trouble.
===
Really?
Look, you guys have been to every play IÂve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
===
No.
Noooo!!
===
 Hey!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
===
You made pancakes?
Yep! Grab a plate.
===
Okay. 
No-no, stay right there.  GettinÂ closer.
===
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Oh yeah, whoÂs playing?
===
 Please, itÂs a relief is what it is, is what it is.
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
===
Ooh, what do I smell?
I donÂt know, it smells good.
===
Wait a minute.
Come here.
===
Why donÂt you ask him out?
Oh, yeah, totally! ThatÂs such a turn-on!
===
Really? It doesnÂt seem desperate?
Oh-ooh, thatÂs the turn-on.
===
I donÂt even know how I would go about it.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doinÂ?"
===
Oh, please!
 Hey, how you doinÂ?
===
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Well, you gotta give him something that he canÂt say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, youÂre guaranteed heÂll say yes!
===
Really?! You think that will work?
Absolutely! And if it doesnÂt, can I get the extra ticket?
===
All right, maybe I should call her.
No! Forget her, man! You donÂt need her, you donÂt need that!
===
Well y'know, what if she didnÂt actually sleep with the guy?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
===
ThatÂs not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! ThereÂs a lot of theories that didnÂt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
===
 Okay, itÂs ready. Come on.
WhatÂs ready?
===
Pretty much.  So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
I donÂt know, it looks the same.
===
You used to have carpet.
Oh yeah!
===
Hey!
HowÂd it go?
===
 So now, what is this now?
Guggly worm.
===
 And this?
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
===
 Hey umm, whatÂs this?
 Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. 
===
 Ohh, GellerÂs got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh!  ItÂs the classic struggle between man andÂ Someone knocked over a lamp.
 ThatÂs all right. Hey you guys, you know whatÂs going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, IÂm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
===
Hey, Joey, I donÂt think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean itÂs only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Look, thereÂs nothing I can do for him right now, heÂs still in his sweat pants, thatÂs still Phase One. Y'know? IÂll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
===
WhatÂs Phase Two?
GettinÂ drunk and going to a strip club. 
===
Because there are naked ladies there.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
===
There are naked ladies there too.
Yeah.
===
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take Âem off and weÂll have some fun.
 Hey-hey!
===
Catch any big fish? 
Oh my God, you guys have no idea. 
===
Are you kidding?!
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-howÂs he doing?
===
He hasnÂt gotten out of that chair in two days.
 Hey buddy! HowÂs it going?
===
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
 Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
===
Oh wait, Joey, you canÂt go like that! You stink!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I donÂt have time! TheyÂre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
===
Yeah, we loves Âem. IÂve never seen him withÂ
 Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
===
You.
YÂknow, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
===
You?
No-no, itÂs uh, itÂs Heston.
===
What?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice. 
===
ThereÂs no way he smells, heÂs the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
===
The one with "Heston" on it.
Interesting.
===
Hello! WhoÂs in there? 
How ya doinÂ?
===
Who in the hell are you?
I guess you wouldnÂt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
===
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, IÂm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, IÂm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
===
picture?
Yeah-yeah, IÂm one of the cops that wonÂt work with you Âcause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, IÂm really sorry, but I stink!
===
Joey, right?
Yeah.
===
 Every actor at one time or anotherÂopp!  Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford wonÂt even watch himself.
Oh no-no-no, you donÂt understandÂ
===
Listen to me!
Oh yeah, yeah.
===
I donÂt know one actor worth his salt that didnÂt say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Yes sir! Yes sir, IÂm-IÂmÂ
===
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
===
Come on, let me see that smile.
I donÂt wanna.
===
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
===
I know, I know, but youÂre gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Yeah, all right. 
===
does this light switch do?
Ohh, Nothing.
===
DidnÂt it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
what it did! Nothing.
===
They wouldnÂt have put it there if it didnÂt do something! How can you not care?
Like this. 
===
Well, hereÂs another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Sure! It flushes it.
===
 Hello!
Hey!  Ah!! 
===
Yeah, IÂm riding the alimony pony. 
And there it is.
===
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityÂWell, theyÂre all back! YÂknow? And sheÂs picked up like nine new ones!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! ThereÂs people here!
===
 Well, I donÂt have to break up with her this time. WeÂre not involved! IÂm going to do a pre-emptive strike! IÂm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!  
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  IÂm tellinÂ ya!
===
 Hey!
Hey! WhatÂs up?
===
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did 
Hey-hey, whatÂs going on?
===
Oh, IÂm packing. YÂknow IÂm-IÂm packing Âcause IÂm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!
===
IÂm only going to pretend IÂm moving to Yemen, itÂs the only way I can get rid off her.
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
===
 Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me!
Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I canÂt believe you said youÂd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
===
ThatÂs Âcause-Âcause youÂre momÂs dog kept-kept looking at me.
 Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. ThatÂs called a scrum, okay? ItÂs kinda like a huddle.
===
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Ross!  TheyÂre gonna kill you!
===
 IÂm sorry. IÂm sorry. YouÂre right, you are a tough guy. YouÂre the toughest palaeontologist I know.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! ItÂs not like heÂsÂChandler!
===
They donÂt look any bigger than me!
Well, maybe thatÂs because youÂre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
===
Okay, I know what I have to do. IÂve got to go Red Ross.  YÂknow, Red Ross!
I totally donÂt know what youÂre talking about.
===
What? No! No, IÂm not stopping. IÂm Red Ross!
Dude, if you go back out there, youÂre gonna be Dead Ross!
===
IÂm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! 
The Red Ross! Okay.
===
Oh no! That-thatÂll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! YÂknow what? IÂm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, itÂs in my pocket. 
Yeah, sure.
===
No, not you. 
Uhh, look, your eyeÂs still popping out a little, IÂm gonna go get some ice.
===
 No!
Oh! Wait-wait!  Is it my bologna sandwich?
===
Yes. Yes. Yes. I canÂt believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I canÂt eat meat!
Oh, wait-wait!  Maybe itÂs a pickle?!
===
Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
===
Right, IÂve got to be off, IÂll see ya. Buh-bye then. 
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
===
Yeah, sheÂs got to go back to London. But you know what? IÂve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and thatÂs it. YÂknow.
Hey thatÂs what all my relationships are like.
===
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
===
What are you talking about?
Yeah, whatÂ going on?
===
Well, as much as IÂd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I arenÂt going to be here. All right? I mean, sheÂs going to come by first to say good-bye, and then IÂve got a whole special evening planned. So IÂm sorry, no party.
Awwww!
===
I said, "Like what?"
Now thatÂs a thinker.
===
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
A little salami. 
===
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Pastrami. 
===
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Yeah. 
===
Ohh, God! Look at him, heÂs so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
===

Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girlÂ
===
She was a welder.
the movie, orÂ Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
===
 Okay, that-thatÂs enough! YÂknow, letÂs, letÂs let someone else play.
If you didnÂt want to play, why did you come to the party?
===
ThereÂs a Phoebe on my sandwich! 
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
===
I canÂt help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
All right look, yÂknow how-yÂknow how when youÂre dating someone and you donÂt want to cheat on them, unless itÂs with someone really hot?
===
Yeah, totally!
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If youÂre going to do something wrong,  do it right!
===
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, IÂm gonna eat like, yÂknow millions of cows.
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
===
What?
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
===
Yeah.
Well, suppose until the babyÂs born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-youÂd just be eating my animals.
===
Joey, I canÂt believe you would do that for me.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. ThereÂs no meat in beer, right?
===
I think youÂre done.
Okay, time to take off the bra. 
===
great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
 Take the bra off.
===
Pastrami.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! YÂknow what goes good with that?
===
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but thatÂs much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
===
Okay.
 Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
===
Six months.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
===
Ohhh, man!!
 What is that?
===
What in the name of hell?
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
===
Hey!
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustÂve hit something on the remote.
===
Do we pay for this?
No, we didnÂt even pay our cable billÂmaybe this is how they punish us.
===
Maybe we shouldnÂt pay our phone billÂfree phone sex.
Maybe we shouldnÂt pay our gas bill? 
===
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And IÂm sad. 
 Why would he turn off the TV? 
===
We donÂt know what could make this go away.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
===
around the TV!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
===
We still have porn.
Hey.
===
You mean like a doctor?
Pheebs! YouÂre blocking the porn! Look out!
===
YÂknow who doesnÂt even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Yeah right.
===
Yes!
Yeah, he likes porn.
===
Hey.
Hey!
===
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
===
What do I do now?
You play hard to get.
===
She already lives in London.
Then you go to Tokyo.
===
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ÂCause you already told her you love her and she didnÂt say it back, then she called you and told you that thereÂs another guy, so yeah, go to London thatÂll scare her!
===
What?
 Nothing. No, nothing.
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didnÂt ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
===
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Noo! Nothing!
===
YÂknow what, we have to turn off the porn.
I think youÂre right.
===
All right, ready?
One.
===
Yeah, thatÂs kinda a relief.
Yeah.
===
You wanna see if we still have it?
Yeah.
===
FREE PORN!!!
Yeah!!
===
Hi!
Hey!
===
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
===
No, IÂm-IÂm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. JoeyÂs your pal. JoeyÂs your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyÂre hanging out with Joey."
===
Hey, yÂknow what, if youÂre gonna do that, if youÂre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! ChandlerÂs funny, sophisticated, and heÂs very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, JoeyÂs loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, heÂll be there.
===
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, heÂll be there. And heÂll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youÂre really hot.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
===
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.  But, all right, I donÂtÂmaybe IÂll just name him The Hulk.
I knew I shouldnÂt have mentioned it! ThatÂs what I wanted to name my kid!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Hey, theyÂre going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! YÂknow they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playfulÂdidnÂt you see 
No, but IÂm gonna!
===
So, I decided IÂm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
===
Raymond Chandler.
Someone you didnÂt make up!
===
famous JoeyÂs. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
===
Wow, youÂre, youÂre right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
IÂm sorry man, I didnÂtÂIÂm-IÂm sorry. IÂm sorry.  
===
Okay.
So I guess itÂs Joey then!
===
No, no, youÂre right, it is a ridiculous name!
ItÂs not that bad.
===
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
So, youÂre just Bing?
===
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
===
ItÂs Clint. ItÂs Clint! 
See you later, Gene.
===
ItÂs Clint! 
WhatÂs up with Gene?
===
 Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Nah, youÂre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
===
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ohh! 
===
this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding? I love that guy!  MorningÂs here! Morning is hereÂ
===
Okay.
apartment.
===
Oh, yeah! You like Âem? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
===
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I donÂt belong here."
You have Knicks tickets?
===
Yeah.
 Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
===
Yeah, what, do you think weÂre stupid?
YouÂre not stupid. YouÂre meaner than I thought.
===
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Yeah, you do!
===
Good one.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
===
 Hey, guys! 
Hey!
===
Oh my God!
We donÂt make enough fun of you already?
===
I like it, and Emily likes it, and thatÂs what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Oh-no, donÂt try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
===
Nothing! ThereÂs nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-sheÂd have to uh, move here. She 
What?
===
And I love the milk! But, IÂm not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now.
All right look, Ross, heÂs right. EmilyÂs great, sheÂs great! But this way too soon, youÂre only gonna scare her!
===
I donÂt want to do that.
No! You donÂt want to wreck it, you donÂt want to go to fast!
===
No thank you.
Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, letÂs trade! The timingÂs perfect, I just clogged the toilet! 
===
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
ItÂs the Knicks!
===
Screw the Knicks!
Whoa!
===
I didnÂt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Huh.
===
And the Knicks rule all.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
===
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Done!
===
Let me finish. 
Oh. 
===
IÂm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
===
Or you could end up with everything.
Ooh, I like that.
===
Op, op, IÂm convinced!
Come on man, you know IÂd do it for you! Because, youÂre my best friend.
===
All right, but you canÂt use that again for a whole year. IÂm in.
All right!
===
Okay. Umm, ooh, oohÂoh, I have a game!
Okay! 
===
This is great!
WhatÂs the game?! WhatÂs the game?!
===
Oh, I have cards!
Oh.
===
ThatÂs a low one!
Yeah! Okay.  Phoebe, you look, I canÂt.
===
What make you think I can?! 
Okay. Okay.  Ace!
===
Because we won our apartment back!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
===
All right, cut, letÂs pick again, pick again.
Okay.
===
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!
Uh-huh, not as high asÂ It worked! King!
===
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Why?!
===
Tickets please!  ThatÂs courtside baby!
Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
===
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? YÂknow, kinda like a peace offering.
===
Oh. Oh, God! 
Hey, want a beer?   WHOA!!!!
===
Well, youÂre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, weÂre switching it back! ThereÂs nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
I donÂt know.
===
What?
I donÂt want to move again! 
===
Totally worth it!
That was one good minute!
===
Good night.
Good night.
===
What-whatÂs going on?
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
===
Oh, well, thatÂs great!
Yeah! Yeah!
===
Yeah. 
Monica and Rachel made out. 
===
Hey! YouÂre back!
Hey!  Get into gear!
===
IÂll see you tomorrow morning!
 Okay!
===
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
 Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
===
HeÂs in a different room! HeÂs really that loud?
 Oh, you should here me.
===
ItÂs not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Look, I told ya, IÂm not going to any clinic! I donÂt have a problem, youÂre the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
===
They donÂt have those.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, youÂve just had your first class!
===
YÂknow I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me overÂ
Ohhh, yeah!
===
Next time you snore, IÂm rolling ya over!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
===
YÂknow, whipped! Wah-pah!
ThatÂs not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
===
ThatÂs what I did. Wah-pah!
You canÂt do anything!
===
ItÂs 6:00.
Yeah, wellÂ
===
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thatÂs, I think thatÂs really cool.
Yeah, Rach, I think youÂre handling that really well.
===
Nothing.
I amÂ  free!
===
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but itÂs going to be torn down, soÂ I mean, I-I know itÂs crazy, but everything up Âtil now has been so crazy, and I donÂt know, this just feels right. YÂknow?
 Hey! ThatÂs the day after I stop menstruating!  This isnÂt mine.
===
Your name, please?
Joey Tribbiani.
===
 Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
 Yeah, she is. Wow!  How you doinÂ?
===
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
 So why donÂt you give me your number?
===
What is that?
 Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and itÂs gonna help me not to snore.
===
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ÂCause I donÂt think you have to wear it unless you are!
 I know I donÂt have too! It tastes good. 
===
YÂknow what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
is getting married.
===
Phoebe is, making people.
EverybodyÂs doing stuff!
===
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
 We could climb Mt. Everest!
===
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
===
Why not?! I mean itÂs just, itÂs just climbing! ItÂs just, itÂs just steep!
Yeah!
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
What-whatÂs up?
WeÂre gonna climb Mt. Everest!
===
 Yeah, wellÂ
We could get that Everest video though.
===
Yeeeeahhhh.
Yeah. Yeah.
===
But IÂll tell you something. One of these days weÂre get off of our buts and rent 
Yeah we are!
===
She was not good. Not good.
She was nothing compared to you.
===
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I canÂt believe my brotherÂs getting married! And in London! ItÂs so romantic!
 Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! YouÂre at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
===
 Hello!
Hey!
===
 Noo.
DonÂt worry man, I get to bring a guest. WeÂll show him.
===
I never knew that either.
I knew that!  I sooo didnÂt know that, but you should see your faces.
===
 Hey guys! WhatÂs up?
Heyyy. 
===
It is off.Â  Right Ross? 
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
===
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that thereÂs a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!  "ItÂs almost as good as being there."
ItÂs better! You canÂt go to a museum in your underwear!
===
Hey.
Hey!
===
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, donÂt you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
===
I sortÂve already asked Chandler.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
===
Joey, I figured youÂd understand. I mean, I-IÂve known him a lot longer.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I donÂt have any brothers; IÂll never get to be a best man!
===
You can be the best man when I get married.
 IÂll never get to be a best man!
===
Oh no-no-no, youÂyeah, of course you get to be my best man.
 What about me?! You-you just said I could!
===
IÂm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
I canÂt believe youÂre not picking me.
===
Fine, yÂknow what, thatÂs it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Yes!  Shame about you man.
===
ItÂs not kicking me, itÂs kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! DonÂt make me come in there!
 Hey!
===
Hey!
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
===
Yeah, thereÂs one right under the cabinet. 
 Thanks.
===
Why do you need it?
Oh, weÂre having a big party tomorrow night. Later! 
===
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Nooo, later. 
===
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come youÂre having a party and weÂre not invited?
Oh, itÂs RossÂs bachelor party.
===
Sooo?
Are you bachelors?
===
Nooo!
Are you strippers?
===
Nooo!
Then youÂre not invited. 
===
All right fine! YouÂre not invited to the party weÂre gonna have either.
Oh-whoa, what party?
===
The baby shower for Phoebe!
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I donÂt want to do! Later! 
===
Great. Great.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, IÂve got you, me, and Chandler and IÂm gonna invite Gunther Âcause, well, weÂve been talking about this pretty loud.
===
IÂll be there.
All rightÂoh! Listen, I know this is your party, but IÂd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
===
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
You got it.
===
See ya.  Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Well, thereÂs gonna be strippers there. He didnÂt say anything about no strippers.
===
He just said, "No strippers."
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
===
Hey listen man, about the stripperÂ
Yeah?
===
 Thanks for not marrying Rachel. 
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther donÂt-donÂt forget your shirt. 
===
Hey-hey, what are those?
Oh, little party favours, check it out! 
===
Wow! Yeah!
Oh-oh! 
===
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck.  Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning.  Thanks Joey.
Oh, hey, donÂt forget your shirt.
===
Oh, thanks! 
Okay, hey, museum geeks, partyÂs over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parentÂs basement. All right.  Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
===
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Yeah!
===
Wow, I didnÂt know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall.  Hardly move.  Be white. 
===
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetinÂ ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a TuesdayÂ
===
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
===
Yeah?
Yeah. IÂll let you play with my duck.
===
 What?
The ring is gone!
===
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisÂAh-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! YouÂre the worst best man ever!
Dude, this isnÂt funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everythingÂs cool! I wake up this morning, the stripperÂs gone and the ring is gone!
===
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!! 
===
Hey!
HeyÂ
===
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. YÂknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, soÂ
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thatÂs nice!
===
Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of thoseÂ
===
So you might say, itÂs a magic ring.
 Yeah, the stripper stole it.
===
 All right-all right, fine! I-IÂm gonna call the cops!
Dude, I screwed up, you donÂt have to turn me in!
===
Not on you! On the stripper!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said theyÂre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
===
Okay, well, weÂll call the company that sent her!
I did that too! They wouldnÂt give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again theyÂd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them IÂm missing a ring!"
===
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That thereÂs nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-IÂ
===
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but weÂve got a ring to find!!
===
WhatÂs he talking about?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
===
Joey! The vet said itÂs a simple procedure.
So! Things can go wrong! You donÂt know! What if he doesnÂt make it?!
===
He will, Joe.
Yeah, but what if he doesnÂt? HeÂs such a good duck.
===
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! 
H-h-h-howÂs the duck?
===
HeÂs doing just fine, heÂs resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
===
No, thatÂs all right.
No, itÂs not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
===
Hey, come on, itÂs not your fault.
Yeah, it is! You wouldnÂt have lost the ring, right? YÂknow what, Ross you were right from the start, he  should be your best man.
===
No, you should.
Now, donÂt argue with meÂ
===
Really?
Really?
===
Thanks man.
 I gotta go check something over here. 
===
You got your passport?
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You donÂt want to lose that.
===
 All right! LetÂs do it!
Woo-hoo!!
===
Yeah, cheerie-o! 
London baby!
===
Okay, Âcause thatÂs not gonna get annoying.
 London baby!!
===
All right, letÂs go! Bye, Pheebs!
Bye, Pheebs!
===
I am, IÂm ignoring you.
Okay, here!  I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. 
===
Oh, what the hell is that?
ItÂs London, baby! All right, the hotelÂs here.  Wait. No, we wanna goÂ No. I know.  IÂm gonna have to go into the map. 
===
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
I got it!  Here we go.
===
Okay. Listen-listen, weÂre not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Shhh!  Man, you made me lose it! 
===
I think itÂs great. ItÂs great. YÂknow, theyÂre thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? To what?
===
To Put the Camera Away!!!
are Westminster Crabby. 
===
So, what are you guys in the market for? WeÂve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. ThatÂs the stuff. What do you think?
===
Well, I donÂt have to buy that, "IÂm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go. 
===
All right, look, youÂre not really gonna buy that are you? DonÂt you think youÂve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you? 
===
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yÂknow, youÂre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh yeah?  If youÂre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
===
Good choice.
Thanks.
===
Hey. 
Oh.  Sorry!
===
No-no-no, yÂknow what? I really shouldnÂt have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnÂt cool. And if it makes you feel any better, IÂve had a really lousy day.
Me too.
===
Yeah?
Noo!! IÂve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
===
 Hey!
Sh-shh-shh! 
===
 Okay, so umm, whatÂs your friendÂs name?
 Oh, Chandler.
===
Oh my God!
ThatÂs Fergie baby!!
===
How did you? How? How?
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, IÂm in my map and-andÂ Hey!
===
IÂm gonna go to the bathroom.
Wait up! 
===
That was pretty intense huh?
Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didnÂt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
===
Hello.
 Hey, Pheebs! ItÂs Joey!
===
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on theÂthat looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say Âhi!Â but then I figured, he doesnÂt care if he looks like you.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
===
time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasnÂt been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Kinda, but IÂve just been having way too much fun.
===
So youÂre not homesick yet?
No, I donÂt think so.
===
All right, the seven of us miss you.
WhoÂs seven?
===
YÂknow, me, Rachel, the birds, the babiesÂ
Ahh, the babies miss me?
===
Ooh, the pizza guyÂs here!
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
===
Yeah. But yÂknow we were thinking about you, yÂknow we ordered the Joey Special.
Two pizzas?!
===
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Wait, well, where did you get it from?! 
===
Okay.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
===
 YouÂve spoiled everything! ItÂs like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
 Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
===
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when thereÂs no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Hey, whatÂs up? 
===
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldnÂt eat meat until she has the babies!
Well, I figured weÂre in another country, so it doesnÂt count.
===
But it absolutely didnÂt.  It didnÂt!! It didnÂt!!
 Ross, hey, the bandÂs ready outside for your first dance with Emily, soÂ
===
 Oh! Oh-oh, the bandÂs ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band saysÂI donÂt care about the stupid band!!
You spit on me man! 
===
Look, IÂm sorry.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
===
Well, IÂve got a girl in here.
No you donÂt, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
===
Well, weÂre-weÂre hanging out in here!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
===
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. ItÂs 
that movie!
===
No.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yÂknow, you think IÂll ever get there?
===
Yes.
Thanks man. 
===
Okay man. 
But what about how much taller he is than me?
===
I know!
Had the beef-tips, huh?
===
Hey!
Hi!
===
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
All right, IÂm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
===
Oh, me too!
Why would you need to say hi to them, youÂve been feeding them for four days?
===
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
===
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
===
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!
===
Hey, Pheebs!
Mornin' Pheebs!
===
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driverÂ
 Was his name Angus? 
===
What?
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
===
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uhÂ
===
Hey!
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
===
Yeah! 
That was good beer.
===
OhhÂ
back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
===
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Later! 
===
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
 I bet it was about her a little.
===
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Say that to him and you're golden. 
===
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
===
So, thanks for having me over! Rach.  Pheebs. 
 See ya!!  What the hell was that?!
===
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
 Havin' some trouble?
===
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
===
Joey, I'm in!
 All right. Good deal.
===
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
===
Yeah?
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
===
Yeah?
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
===
 
Yeah, all of us! All day!
===
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Phoebe!
===
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Mine!
===
plan.
said we needed a new plan.
===
gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This  is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
===
 Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice.  And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
I gotta get the before shot!
===
Okay.
Oh!  And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! 
===
Hey! You okay?
Ooh, something hurts!
===
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
===
 Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh my!
===
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
===
dirty?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken saladÂ
===
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
===
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
===
So they're going on dates? When?
I think SaturdayÂ.
===
Fine! Maybe I will too!
 Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up! 
===
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
===
It's kidney stones.
Or?
===
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
===
 Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethraÂ
===
I do too! I do too!
Argh!
===
Argh!
Argh!
===
You did it, man.
Would you like to see them? 
===
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
===
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
 He's talking to London!
===
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
===
 I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
===
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
===
Vomit tux? Who vomited onÂy'know what, what you up to Joe?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
===
Oh that's great!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
===
with them?
Why donÂt you like PBS, Pheebs?
===
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
===
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
===
What-what are you talking about?!
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
===
Yeah. So?
feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
===
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Well, may I ask for one example?
===
Are you calling me selfish?!
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
===
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
That he doesn't exist.
===
This will be your phone.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
===
No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!
===
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
===
 Hello.
 Hey Mon!
===
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure. 
===
 You're not on TV.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? 
===
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Hello New York! 
===
 Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
===
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
===
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
===
 Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
===
would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
did to ya?
===
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not 
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
===
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
===
Uhh, 9. 
But it's dark out.
===
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. 
===
 Hey.
Hey!
===
 Hi, guys!
Hi!
===
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
we flip it.
===
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
 Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
===
Condoms?
may have to repopulate the Earth.
===
Damn 
Hey, you're back!
===
Hey.
How was your conference?
===
It was terrible. I fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another 
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
===
 Hi!
Hey, you're back too!
===
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hey, how was your chef thing?
===
Urghh!!
 What are you guys woofing about?
===
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
You want my advice?
===
Yes! Please!
You're not gonna like it.
===
That's okay.
You got married to fast.
===
That's not advice!
I told ya.
===
I'm going to the bathroom. 
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
===
 Hi!
Hi, Rach.
===
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Hey, you're not Kip!
===
 Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?
===
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
===
 Hey!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
===
Yes that was mine.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
===
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
===
I know that too.
  Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
===
Joey, can I talk to you for a second? 
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
===
Yes. Yes. 
 You?!  And-and you?!
===
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!
===
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
===
Uh-huh!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
===
What?!
about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Eeeee--ohh!! God! 
Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
===
I'll take it all.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
===
Now calm down Joey.
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
===
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
===
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
I'll take it!
===
That might work! 
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?
===
 No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. 
What's the matter Ross?
===
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
===
 Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
===
Yeah!
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
===
fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. 
===
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. 
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
===
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
===
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choiceÂ
have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
===
Why?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
===
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
===
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Yeah!
===
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
===
Oh, I know.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
===
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! 
===
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
===
 You're kinda stepping on the song. 
out of line, we totally support you.
===
You do, huh?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're aloneÂ
===
What are you talking about?
 I'm not sure.
===
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actorÂ
===
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
===
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
===
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile! 
===
Why, what happened?
What happened? What happened?
===
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
No, look. 
===
That's a pig.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
===
What?! 
Why?
===
Who needs a lease when 
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
===
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Yeah.
===
You got it.
Okay.
===
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tÂI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
===
What are you doing?
Nothing.
===
You built a fort didn't ya?
 Kinda.
===
 Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was 
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
===
this thing!
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
===
 Joey, please! 
Sorry.
===
 Hello children!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
===
Okay. 
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
===
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing!
===
 All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
===
No-no-no-no!
YES!!
===
Okay, so he's out of here.
Um-hmm.
===
Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
===
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
===
I don't know, clean places?
Umm, yum!
===
I'll take sports.
Mine! 
===
All right. Uhh, international.
Oh that's mine too!  I'm Italian!
===
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
===
Yes, it is.
Hey, let's go look at it! 
===
Okay, let's go.
Okay!
===
Let's go quicker.
Yeah!
===
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
===
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
===
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Yeah.
===
 So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Oh, it's perfect!
===
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
===
Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!
===
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yeah!
===
What are we gonna do?
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
===
About Ross!
Oh! Oh!
===
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
 Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! 
===
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
You're kidding!
===
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. SoÂ
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! 
===
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there  by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
===
Are you guys sure about this?
Definitely!
===
All right.
All right!
===
All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
===
I couldn't possibly eat another bite. 
I need something sweet.
===
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
===
Oh God, no.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
===
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
===
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
===
 Hello?
Phoebe?
===
Joey? What's going on?
Look. 
===
Oh my God!
I know! It's stuck!!!
===
 Easy. Step. How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler!
===
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
bad in here.
===
Hey, did you get the turkey bastedÂOh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?
It's Joey.
===
Well, get it off now!
I can't! It-it's stuck!
===
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.  Joey? Now is not the time!
Sorry! Sorry.
===
Arghhhhhh!! 
 It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
===
I'm over here big guy.
 Yeah, you are!  I scared you!
===
 You did look like an idiot.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
===
 Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
You're a dork.
===
Why are they here?
I don't know uhhÂ  Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
===
 Take 'em!  Joey, you can touch them! They're 
 Chandler? A word.
===
 Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me!  Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and 
===
 Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can'tÂ
===
 All this lying has been hard on us too.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
===
Help!
All right! But,  you do it with me once.
===
Joey!
Didn't think so.
===
Hey, Pheebs!
Hey, Pheebs!
===
 Hi.
What's wrong buddy?
===
 Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
===
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
So you uh, still wondering?
===
No, we just went out.
You're smart. I like that.
===
Oh, candles!  What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God! 
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
===
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! 
Hiya.
===
Yeah.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
===
OhÂI don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
===
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good.  Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
===
 Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
===
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
a pervert! Okay? It's justÂ I justÂ KindaÂ
===
Joey's a sex addict. 
What?!!  No I'm not!!
===
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
a sex addict!
===
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
===
What's going on?
 I slept with Monica.
===
You slept with my sister?
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
===
Monica, is this true?
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
===
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
AhhÂoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
===
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
===
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense!
===
And the video camera?
Uhh, Monica?
===
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
===
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. 
===
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those 
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
===
Or that.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
===
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
===
Yeah!
Thanks!
===
 All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Done!
===
And it can't be Joey.
It's not.
===
Or Joseph.
 Oh.
===
Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
===
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler 
You're driving me crazy with that!
===
Okay, I'll stop.
DonÂt stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
===
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
===
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
 All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
===
I'm intrigued. 
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. 
===
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
===
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Uh yeah, right here. 
===
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
===
 And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on! 
Hey!
===
Joey's not going.
 I didn't finish my five pages.
===
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
===
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
===
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on look guys, don't fight.
===
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
===
Âso we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
===
When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureÂI didn't have my camera!
===
Okay, see? I told you!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
===
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister!!!
===
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
 Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
===
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
===
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
===
All right. 
Okay.  "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross 
===
 I'm sorry too.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
===
I am sorry, Ross.
A handsome man enters.  Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You,  you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you  well you co-created Fireball. The end.
===
This took you all day?!
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball.  Ha-ha!
===
I'm not reading this!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
===
 Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
===
 We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?!
===
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'knowÂ
All right, I'll take care of it.
===
 73! 72! 71!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
===
What?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
===
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Chandler.
===
Awww, man! Really?
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
===
That's a good point.
Yeah.
===
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Okay, great!
===
All right.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
===
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
===
So?
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
===
Oh, good point.
Yeah!
===
 Happy New Year, Joey!
So did that do anything for ya?
===
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now!
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
===
Really?! How come?
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
===
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
===
me.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
===
Nice!
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
===
Horn-swoggle.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
===
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. 
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! 
===
All right, see you later.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. 
===
Okay.  Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here,  then you learn here. 
Umm, okay.
===
I didnÂt! Even when I found outÂumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. 
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. 
===
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! 
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store andÂ
===
any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
No.
===
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Yes!
===
I like 'em.
Yeah! 
===
 Okay, seriously, what do you think?
You look like a freak.
===
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. 
===
Tiger!  Dragon! Iceberg!!  Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Yes! Yes, I did.
===
Then do Iceberg!
  G-sharp.
===
No, but you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?! 
===
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Your other student, was you!
===
 Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
===
can help me!
Okay.
===
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroomÂ
Nice!
===
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
===
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!  
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
===
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
===
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
===
What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm justÂif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
===
Dude, what am I gonnaÂ
 Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. 
===
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
===
to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?
===
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
===
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
===
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! 
===
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phoneÂ 
I'm not listening to you!
===
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.  You really think I'm ready?
===
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool! 
===
That really is something; that's really cool.
Howdy partner!
===
Hey, uh, Joey?
Umm?
===
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Oh, no! 
===
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
===
 Yeah. Well.  Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
===
Yeah!
Do you know something?
===
Do you know something?
I might know something.
===
I might know something too.
What's the thing you know?
===
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
I can't tell you what I know.
===
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Okay, fine.
===
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Yeah, I know!!!!
===
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! ListenÂ 
===
Come on Joey!!!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
===
I can't believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
===
deal!  Fine I wantÂI need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
 I don't know.
===
Is he romantic with her?
I don't know.
===
Are they in love?
 I don't know.
===
You don't know anything.
Ohh, I know one thing!
===
What?
They did it right there on the couch. 
===
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
 Anybody gonna eat that?
===
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-inÂ  Actually, thanks!
 All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
===
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Really?
===
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
===
That's okay, Joe.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
===
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
===
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
===
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
 He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
===
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
===
Ross! Janice?!
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
===
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
===
gonna see her again.
Damnit Phoebe!!
===
Uh-hmm.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.  And they're off! 
===
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.
===
Hey!
Yeah!
===
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. WeÂ
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
===
 No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
===
Ohh, tough call.
Yeah.
===
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
===
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justÂI didn't know what it was!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
===
 Hey.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! 
===
 This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
===
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
===
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
===
Sure!  God, please take those off!
All right. 
===
Is everything okay?
Are you all right?
===
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Pheebs! Sorry!
===
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
===
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
===
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. 
Really? A purse?
===
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a women's purse.
===
Exactly! Unisex!
had sex a couple days ago.
===
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
===
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
===
 Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. 
===
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
===
All right, then you owe me $350.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? 
===
 JoeyÂ
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
===
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
U-N-I-sexy?  
===
Hey, how are you holding up?
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
===
 Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Here, I brought you some flowers. 
===
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
What did you say to him?
===
And a date with a man!
is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey,  comes with a bag! 
===
Any time you're ready, Joey.
 Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
===
 I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure.  Well, you must be new here. Maybe we shouldÂI'm sorry, can I ask you something? 
===
Sure. What?
Well, first it's not a purse.
===
Okay, anytime.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
===
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
All right look, let me show you the catalog!  See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
===
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
===
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Yeah but I didnÂt read anything.
===
I think we've seen enough!
Okay! All right, I'll see ya.   We got it! We got it!
===
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it. 
===
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
===
What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
===
Nooooo!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
===
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
===
ÂI just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
===
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
===
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
 Hey guys!
===
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
===
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more? 
===
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
===
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
===
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
I can't take anyÂ
===
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets!  I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
===
You don't have any secrets!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. 
===
 So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Ugh.
===
Phoebe knows about us!
didn't tell them!
===
Them?! Who's them?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
===
Joey!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
===
UnlessÂ
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
===
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
I'm listening.
===
Yeah, he broke those too.
So he likes to break stuff.
===
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
===
I can not believe he would do that to MonÂWhoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?
No.
===
Joey!
They know you know.
===
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
===
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
 Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
===
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh!
===
Okay!
I like that!  Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! 
===
Joey!  Wow, you didnÂt rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
===
I justÂI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
===
God! 
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
===
Ross knows about me and Monica.
 Dude! He's right there!
===
 You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? 
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business?  Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
===
 Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
 I call Godfather!
===
Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
===
Hi!
So, are you ready to go?
===
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Oh sure, right back there. 
===
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
I was thinking Chinese food.
===
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, butÂ
===
But what?
 She keeps punching me.
===
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay?  She-she-she's hurting me.
===
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! 
 Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
===
Oh, no!
No-no.
===
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Yeah, big!
===
Hi! Wow! You look, you lookÂbig.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
===
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Well look, IÂm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
===
 Hi!
Hey! Hiya!
===
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
===
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
UhhÂ.
===
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Nah.
===
Oh-no. No. No.
What a bad idea!
===
Hey!
She's right y'know.
===
No, I will not!
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
===
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all!
===
Hey!
What are you guys doing up?
===
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
 Dark red.
===
 Yes, you are so smart! 
Aww, you guys are so cute!
===
I know.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
===
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! 
 Hey, you guys!
===
Hey.
 Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
===
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and IÂm not him.
===
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
===
Are you saying I smell bad?
No! No, you smell like a meadow.  I'm sorry. 
===
 Hey.
 Hey!  Oh.
===
Hi, Joe.
Yeah, I didnÂt know you guys were going to be here.
===
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. 
 What?! Why?!
===
What is going on with you?
Nothing!
===
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it. 
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I donÂt want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
===
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream? 
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. 
===
What was the dream about?
were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
===
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesnÂt mean that-that you're in love with me!
It-it doesnÂt?
===
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
===
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
===
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
 Not really.
===
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
===
before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Friends first? That's interesting.
===
You become friends after?
No, never done that either.
===
 What's up Joey?
 How you doin'?
===
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you.
===
Thanks!
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
===
I know.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
===
What's up Joe?
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so greatÂ
===
Yeah?
Âis because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. SoÂ
===
 What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
===
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'll treat you real nice. 
===
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. 
===
 Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Uhh, well, she'sÂreally good in bed.
===
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
 Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
===
What?! Why?!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!
===
What about the closeness?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
===
Oh my God!
Uhh, just a minute officer!! 
===
I know!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
===
Wh-what?!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
===
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. 
===
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that.  Okay, here goes.  How  you  a-doin'?   It worked! She's waving me over.  Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floorÂ
===
 Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Tell me about it, huh?  Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica!  Ewwuck! 
===
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
This is your place?
===
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. 
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! 
===
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.  Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. 
===
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
===
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!"  Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
What happened?
===
 All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward meÂ Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhhÂ 
You kissed him?!
===
Yes!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
===
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yeah!  No?
===
Maybe. I-I don't knowÂOh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on.  She's back! Hot girl's back!
===
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
No, in Ross's building!  She's back! She's back!  Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.  Got it! 
===
Yes?
 Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
===
No. I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that.  Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
===
Daddy!!
Later!  Oh man!  Hot girl! Hot girl!!
===
 Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet.  Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
===
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
===
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
apartment from the left.
===
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
know that! Thank you Monica.  I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
===
Sure.  JoeyÂ
Dahhhhh!!  No! Noooo!! 
===
Okay. 
All right now, memorize it.  You got it?
===
Oh yes.
 Is that your card? 
===
 Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
 Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
===
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swingsÂ
on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
===
 Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Luck!
===
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
===
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
===
 Okay!!
Done.
===
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
===
Weirder than watching his two moms make out? 
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
===
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
===
You're not his godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?!
===
 Of course I am!  Okay, let's go godfather.
All right!
===
Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of herÂ
===
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, 
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
===
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do! 
===
 Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
 Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
===
You got a callback too didn't you?
 Yeah I did!
===
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks soÂ
===
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Who knows?
===
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
===
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two  or you two.  
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
===
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!
Hey Pheebs!  Hey!
===
Hey!
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
===
What's up?
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
===
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
===
Well, you justÂ
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
===
What?!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
===
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
At least I care about his feelings!
===
What?!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnÂt get it?
===
And why wouldn't he get it?
what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
===
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon baby!
===
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
===
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Yeah?! So's yours!
===
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Oh yeah, no problem.
===
 Joey!
 Ross!
===
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready. 
Uh-oh.
===
Is there a problem?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
===
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
===
Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!
===
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
===
Y'know what? We need to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! 
===
Hey!
Hey.
===
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Yeah right! 
===
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." 
===
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care 
What you do mean?
===
I think, sub-consciouslyÂ
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
===
 I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actorÂ
===
No!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
===
There you go. Thank you!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
===
No.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
===
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
 Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
===
So, Joey on 
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
===
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.  I've done it again.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me. 
===
hotter than I am.
 True story! 
===
Okay that is the one we already have!
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here!  Oh my God.
===
What?
 Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
===
 Well, what is it?
 Oh, they cut me out of the show.
===
 Maybe your scene's coming up?
 Not likely.Â  'Cause you see that body bag right there
===
 Yeah.
 I'm in it.
===
 That's not good.
 No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! 
===

Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! 
===
 No! Sam Waterston!
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
===
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
 All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
===
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!
I know, I know! What am I going to do?  Ooh!
===
gonna run out and leave her here!
 Yeah, all right.  Ooh! 
===
Yay!
 Hey! Is the show still on?
===
Almost over man.
 Look! Oh!  Is that the Pope?! 
===
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
===
Oh Joey!
That's right!
===
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
 Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars.  Choo! Choo! Choo!  Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get itÂ Choo!! And if I don't get it,  I'm gonna shoot this duck!
===
Oh no!
 I'm comin' out! 
===
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Oh, yeah, good idea.
===
 Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.  
Ooh, Ross, look! Look! 
===
 What? Where?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
===
What am I looking at?
 Somebody help me out here!
===
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
You got to go on a ride along?!
===
Uh-huh!
I want to go on a ride along!
===
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Oh-ho, yeah!
===
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yep!
===
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
 Yeah okay.  Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
===
tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
===
 Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Did I say you could smell it?!
===
I can't smell your sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
===
Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
===
Okay.
Are you thinking about Monica?
===
Yeah.
Yeah, what's that like?
===
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
===
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
===
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
===
What? What? What? What is it?
Is everything okay?
===
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.  Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
 You okay man?
===
Uh, 
Hi.
===
didn't know that!
Yeah, I didn't know that.
===
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. WhateverÂ
Is something wrong?
===
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay.
===
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
===
I do not hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
===
What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
===
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! IÂknewÂyou could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
===
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
===
From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much senseÂ
===
sense?!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
===
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
===
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
===
Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.
===
Thanks. 
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
===
 Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?
===
Hm-hmm. 
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
===
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!
===
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches. 
===
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten 
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
===
 2:17.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
===
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
===
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
===
 Hey, you guysÂ
Hey!
===
What-what is it?!
What the hell is that?!!
===
ON A CAT??!!!!
It's not a cat!
===
 Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing.
===
Yeah?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
===
it would! Let's do it!
Okay!
===
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
===
 Hey guys!
Hi!
===
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.  It was right here, where is it?
I don't know.
===
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Oh, I don't knowÂ. Yeah, can't do it.
===
drop that ball!
Yeah, we haven't dropped it inÂ 
===
I don't want a cat!
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
===
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.
===
He's a dropper!
Oh yeah, that's right!
===
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We  invented this game!
===
Oh, thank God!
Did you get your money back?
===
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Oh hey, here Pheebs. 
===
Chandler!
Me too! Me too! Me too!  
===
You okay there man?
Yeah, I got too excited!
===
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
 Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what.  I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
===
Ohh-oh, chilling!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas!  And you know what that means buddy!
===
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
===
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Oh umm, not go.
===
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
===
Yeah, I've been around.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
===
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Great! Problem solved!
===
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, back to square one.
===
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
 Yes!
===
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind.  Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Peanut butter!
===
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
A swimmer!
===
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Monica. OhÂ huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
===
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Ascot!
===
North route or south route?
North route!
===
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
===
Oh, this guy again. 
Hey man, what's up?
===
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Sure, what do you want to see?
===
I don't know, ummÂ
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
===
What's with her?
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
===
Okay.
What do you like better action or comedy?
===
Action.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? 
===
Dude, you are sick.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
===
 Hey!
Hey! You ready to go?
===
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
===
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
===
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
You got it!
===
Bye you guys!
Bye-bye!
===
Okay!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
===
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry, it's out there!  I think I just need lunch.
===
Yeah.
You wanna eat?  My treat!
===
Isn't that Ross's money?
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
===
I don't know.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
===
Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
===
Too dry.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
===
No!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
===
No!
 What?!
===
Yes.
Dude you said, "No!"
===
I also said, "Yes!"
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
===
No!  Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this!
===
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
===
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
===
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
===
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
===
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
===
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Fine!  Get out!
===
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!
===
 Hello?   It's Joey.   I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
 Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
===
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
===
Hey, dude!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
===
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!
===
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
 You're kidding right?
===
No.
What?!
===
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
===
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
No!
===
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yeah.
===
These got left for ya. 
Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break. 
===
 Hello?
 Hey Monica, it's Joey!
===
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
===
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here! 
===
Sure! Where is it?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
===
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
===
Who was that?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
===
Hey! Joey!  Hey! Hey!! Wow! 
Hi!
===
Love your condoms my man.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
===
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.  Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
===
Who are you talking too?
They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
===
Why?! What happened?!
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
===
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya.  I'm sorry man.
===
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Yeah, what-what's going on?
===
Monica had lunch with Richard.
Dawson?! 
===
Thanks. 
Aww, there we go.
===
 Next time?
Ooh, so close.
===
What are you talkingÂ
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! 
===
Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it rightÂ
===
Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
===
Good luck! 
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
===
Changing one hundred!  Good luck sir.
 Let's ride.
===
 13.
Hit me!  Ohh man!  Wait! 
===
 What?
My identical hand twin!
===
What's an identical hand twin?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
===
Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
DonÂt you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
===
 How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
===
Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice? Huh?
===
 Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
===
Hey!
Pheebs!!
===
Yeah?
I found my identical hand twin!
===
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
 Hey-hey-hey you made it!
===
Joey!!
All right! Hey-hey!
===
Hi!!
Who's your friend? He's hot! 
===
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
===
Your what?
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
===
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
===
Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Excuse me?
===
It's me, Joey!
Do I know you?
===
 Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
===
are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Nothing?
===
That's okay. 
 But you haven't even heard the chorus!
===
That must be our alcohol and beers!  
Hey!
===
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! 
Hi!
===
Hey!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
===
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.   Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks!  Hey Rach, how you doin'?
===
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore! 
===
 Ahhh! 
Are you gonna play?
===
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anywayÂ 
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
===
 Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card?  Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
 14.
===
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Stop it!
===
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Please stop it!
===
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
 If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
===
Come on, lady! 
Please, please take him too. 
===
Oh my God!
 Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
What are you guys doing here?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! IsnÂt that why you guys are here?
===
Why else would we be here?
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
===
Oh Joey, IÂm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Nah, IÂm too depressed to eat. IÂll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess IÂll just fly home with you guys, what timeÂs your flight?
===
What about my cab?
I donÂt need that anymore.
===
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
I donÂt want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.  OhÂooh! How about you come with me?
===
I donÂt know, itÂs such a long trip.
ItÂll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
===
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?
===
Hi!
Hey.
===
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Where is the waitress?! IÂm starving!
===
ItÂs a buffet man.
Oh, hereÂs where I win all my money back! 
===
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Sure! WhatÂs up? 
===
Look, I just donÂt think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! YÂknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. YÂknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh! Tell her sheÂs not marriage material.
===
What?!
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if sheÂs anything like me, sheÂs just gonna be relieved.
===
Laugh it up, but the jokeÂs on you. Because we donÂt need to get divorced, okay? We weÂre just gonna get an annulment. 
An annulment? Ross! I donÂt think surgeryÂs the answer here.
===
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You canÂt win if you donÂt ask any  
 What?!
===
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radioÂs broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Really? I donÂtÂ
===
 How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rapeÂ, a rapist or a killer or something!
DonÂt you think I asked him that before he got in?!
===
the license plate game!
Ooh, IÂll play! IÂll play!
===
Stop it! Stop it no! ThatÂs not fair! YÂknow I canÂt resist that beautiful voice!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didnÂt deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
===
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? IÂve got a really good one! IÂve been thinking about it since Kansas.
===
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Yes.
===
Is it a meatball sub?
That is incredible! You are the master!
===
The keyÂs stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on.  Look out. Look out. 
===
 It still doesnÂt work.
IÂm not finished.
===
All right.
 Hey Monica!
===
Hi!
Â Hey man, you feeling any better? 
===
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! YouÂre pregnant!
===
No-o-o!  No?  No-o-o! Look Joey, hereÂs the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, IÂm gonna be moving out man.
Wow!  Well, uhÂ Hey! IÂm really happy for you guys! Congratulations!  See you later. 
===
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like youÂd believe that. This sucks!
===
Look, I-IÂm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up IÂm moving right back in with you!
 Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if youÂre gonna be moving in with him I feel itÂs my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? HeÂs a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to ummÂ Oh-oh he always, he always ummÂOh, who am I kidding! HeÂs the best roommate ever! 
===
Look, IÂm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we wonÂt be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
===
Hey!
Hi.
===
I mean, all IÂm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! DonÂt I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! ItÂs like the end of an era! No more J-man and ChannieÂs!! 
===
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?
===
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it wonÂt work out.
Wow.
===
I know. Then, IÂm gonna marry Chandler for the money and youÂll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great!
===
But then we ditch those two and thatÂs when we get married. WeÂll have ChandlerÂs money and RachelÂs kids and getting custody will be easy because of RachelÂs drinking problem.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
===
Yes, Denise. Denise! 
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
===
Oh, thatÂs true.
Yeah, why donÂt you move in with me? ItÂll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked ThursdayÂs right?
===
Who was it?
I donÂt know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez! 
===
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But youÂre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. 
===
Oh donÂt worry, IÂm not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, donÂt be just blurtinÂ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
===
 You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! IÂll be living here. 
Oh donÂt listen to him, heÂs just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I donÂt think heÂs gonna get it.
===
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
That thing was a hazard!  IÂm very safety conscious.
===
Yeah, IÂm-IÂm sure.  Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. 
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
===
IÂve been back and forth.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it youÂre right where you donÂt want to be! Back together!
===
Yeah, well, m-maybe youÂre right.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
===
All right, well the place was closed. IÂll just copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why donÂt you just move in with me? 
===
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-noÂ ItÂs okay, I mean IÂlook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked ThursdayÂs thing, but we donÂt have to do that!
===
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youÂre thinking about Naked WednesdayÂs.
ThursdayÂs clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
===
Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, IÂm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
===
I can do that.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
===
Fight.
Very good! Okay. G.
===
String?
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
===
Kitten?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, butÂbye-bye! 
===
Phoebe thatÂs crazy!
I canÂt believe she would say that too you.
===
 "Âsubcategories. The first of these subcategories isÂ"
 Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
===
No! Why?
Well, IÂve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didnÂt have naked chicks on it.
===
Some uh, some visual aides.
Oh-ooh-ooh! YÂknow whatÂs a good visual aide?
===
Please donÂt say naked chicks.
Why not?!
===
Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
===
Yes, you got something from the Screen ActorÂs Guild.
Ooh, itÂs probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, IÂm kindaÂ.
===
 "Benefits lapsed."
Hmm thatÂs weird. I donÂt remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
===
Okay, itÂs not a check. TheyÂre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnÂt work enough last year.
Let me see that!
===
All right.
 Oh, I canÂt believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yÂknow? And it wouldnÂt matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
===
IÂm sorry man, thereÂs never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. IÂm gonna go see my agent.
===
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
 Âlook both ways before you cross the street. 
===
Really?!
Yeah!
===
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
===
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?
===
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Bastard!
===
Hey!
 Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and IÂll have my health insurance back in no time.
===
ThatÂs great, but shouldnÂt you be on the toilet right now?
What?!
===
WhatÂs wrong with you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havenÂt been able to stand up since. But um, I donÂt think itÂs anything serious.
===
This sounds like a hernia. You have toÂyou-you go to the doctor!
No way! ÂKay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything itÂs gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! 
===
ThatÂs a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
===
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you 
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides itÂs getting darker and more painful, that means itÂs healing.
===
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and letÂs just get that thingÂpushed back in.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I donÂt want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, IÂm thinking IÂll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
===
Hey.
Hey!
===
Hey! Maybe youÂll die!
Sure, now IÂm scared.
===
No, we can go together! Just donÂt wait too long though, okay? ÂCause IÂm outta here sometime before Friday.
Yeah, but I donÂt wanna die!
===
Whenever youÂre ready.
 Okay. "Hey, Timmy, IÂve got a surprise for you."
===
Hold it. IÂm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little lessÂintense?
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, IÂll justÂhold on one second.   "Hey Timmy, IÂve got a surprise for you!"
===
ThatÂs where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.
===
No.
Yeah, okay. 
===
You mean dying man?
Yes!
===
Listen, IÂm really glad you got the part.
 Thank you.
===
But are you sure you can do this?
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
===
never talking about it again?!
 Hiya!
===
Hey Joey, weÂre ready for ya!  Joey, this is Alex heÂs going to be playing your son.
Hi Alex!  And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. 
===
And Action!
"Take could care of your Momma son."  "Take could care of your Momma son."  "Come on son! Your MommaÂs good people!"
===
All right! LetÂs try this again! You ready Joe?
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
===
Uh sure.
Okay. 
===
Action!
 "Take good care of your Momma son." 
===
Have you really done this before?
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, donÂt hold back.  and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
===
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
===
Yeah, thatÂs what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
===
Joey, why donÂt you put them in the lost and found?
ThereÂs a lost and found?  My shoe! 
===
You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didnÂt realize until I got home. I wasnÂt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! YÂknow what? IÂm gonna go find that guyÂs car and leave a note on the windshield. 
===
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, IÂll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks. 
===
Nice car!
Yeah, itÂs not mine.
===
 I love your car.
Yeah, itÂs  mine.
===
I bet itÂs fast.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
===
Yeah!
 ItÂs got Âem!
===
Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.
 Hey guys!
===
Hey!
Hey babies! Oh, IÂm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche IÂve got the keys too, still there!
===
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get when IÂm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
===
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyÂre gonna start to think that I donÂt own it. So I figured IÂll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
===
Wow!
And thatÂs just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
===
Really! You got a place upstate?
Sure!
===
Well, IÂll see you later.
Okay, take it easy.
===
Hey! ThatÂs my car.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
===
What-what are you doing?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now IÂm just polishing her up.
===
But itÂs my car!
Yeah, but itÂs my wax.
===
Listen, I-I-I donÂt come to this city much so I donÂt know if youÂre crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Sure. Here.  IÂll uh, save your parking spot.
===
IÂm not coming back.
Why not?
===
I live upstate.
Yeah, so did I.
===
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
===
And people will think you own a Porsche because youÂre wearing the clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnÂt have the car! Right?
===
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, IÂve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. 
===
Joey, you know you donÂt actually have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! IÂm in character! Would you talk to her! 
===
Maybe because youÂve got the keys?
 Porsche.
===
That was the only way I could get him to 
Hi! How are the Gellers? 
===
The judge wouldnÂt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? 
Hey! ItÂs Porsche!! 
===
 Hi Joey.
Hey! How you doinÂ?
===
 He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
IÂd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. SheÂs sleeping.  Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? 
===
First of the month.
And thatÂs every month?
===
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Ahhh.
===
Okay, here is the phone bill. 
 Oh my God!!
===
ThatÂs our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why donÂt I justÂwhy donÂt I just cover you for a while?
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityÂanymore.
===
ItÂs not charity, JoeÂ
No! Forget it! OkayÂI mean thanks, but IÂm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whatÂs next? Come on.
===
Okay uh, hereÂs the electric bill. 
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I donÂt know Ross, not if youÂre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
===
Why not?
 IÂve got Ben.
===
Oh, I wish IÂd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh thatÂs okay. Hey, actually in a way itÂs kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
===
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You havenÂt beaten me once since my injury plagued Â97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
===
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, youÂre on.
===
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?
===
Oh yes!
Okay, get ready to owe me!
===
Okay.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
===
Still broken?
This sucks man! The last night youÂre here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
===
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? 
Nah, not my game.
===
Okay, uh, how about, how aboutÂyÂknow what? We could play a new game. A new game, itÂs fun.
Well, whatÂs it called?
===
Cups.
I donÂt know how to play Cups.
===
IÂll teach ya! Come on, come on, itÂs really easy and really, really fun.
All right.
===
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
A two and a five.
===
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
===
Oh yeah! Okay, letÂs play again.  What do you got?
A four and a nine.
===
YouÂre kidding right?
No. Why?
===
Well thatÂs a full cup! 
Damn! I am good at Cups!
===
You win.
Well, what did you have?
===
It doesnÂt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Uh,  wow, 700.
===
Not 700 exactly?
Yeah.
===
Double it! 
What?
===
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Really?
===
WhatÂs wrong?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
===
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the SittinÂ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnÂt even get half a cup! NothinÂ!!
===
All right, letÂs play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! IÂm serious this time! In-in fact, look, thereÂs aÂI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yÂknow, thank you for being such a great roommate.
===
I canÂt take the big white dog! You love it!
ItÂs him, not it!
===
No, but waitÂwhat if I bought it from you, yÂknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?
Wait a second, I see what youÂre trying to do here! You-youÂre trying to give me money again!
===
When did I try to give you money?
Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
===
IÂm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youÂre okay.
be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I canÂt take care of myself. Okay? Look, IÂm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that IÂm gonna missÂis you. And now the dog.
===
Hi
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
===
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
===
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
 From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
===
I'm a dancer.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
===
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Oh, hey let me. 
===
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Of course I did.
===
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
"When can you move in?"
===
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
===
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Oh God, yeah.
===
at the supermarket.
 Okay!
===
No-no
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
===
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
===
 Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
===
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man.  Joe?  Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. 
 I Gotcha!!
===
 Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
===
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, MonicaÂs gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
 I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
===
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too. 
===
 Why don't you try to do-
 
===
What's wrong?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower.  Oh my God!
===
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
 Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. 
===
That's not specific to girls.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
===
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
===
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
===
Is there something wrong?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
===
Joey...
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
===
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Oh!
===
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel 
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
===
I don't think so.
doin?
===
I'm OK
What?!?!
===
What?
Oh dear God!
===
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttinÂ up, eh?
===
over to my new apartment.
Well maybe I love yaÂ.
===
Are you guys going to ChandlerÂs for Thanksgiving?
Yeah! Yeah, why? WhatÂs up?
===
No, but you should go to ChandlerÂs. Because none of us knows how to cook, weÂll probably just end up drinking all day.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
===
Hey!
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
===
And the place looks so nice!
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
===
Happy Thanksgiving!
Well, this has been great!
===
And who else is going to be there?
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
===
Her dancer friends?
 Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and theyÂre gonna be, be drinkinÂ and dancin, and we really wanna go!
===
Oh, but-but it is, uh, itÂs just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
===
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, yÂknow, I thought Âwell, thereÂs mincemeat pie,Â I mean thatÂs an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, yÂknow. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Y-sure!
===
 And while IÂm gone donÂt you boys sneak a taste.
 Okay.
===
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
 Chandler!
===
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...SheperdÂs Pie!
 Oh man! Now sheÂs gonna start all over! WeÂre never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
===
No, no, we will. We just wonÂt tell her she messed up.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
===
Yeah, itÂll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
 Vomiting stories are funny...
===
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
===
No!
 Still not hot enough!
===
 No, I did, but tell me again, because itÂs so romantic.
Well youÂre whippinÂ so slow! CanÂt you do it any faster?
===
So why donÂt you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh I am!
===
What?! What is with everybody? ItÂs Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, theyÂre all gonnaÂ make fun of her, do you want that?
===
Okay, okay, weÂll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! 
 Dude, theyÂre not objects.
===
Joey, youÂre gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You donÂt get any dessert.
 Really?
===
It tastes like feet!
I like it.
===
Are you kidding?
WhatÂs not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
===
 I wasnÂt supposed to put beef in the trifle!
 I wanna gooooooo!
===
Well actually, I-I didnÂt eat mine. ItÂs still in the bathroom.
No it isnÂt, I ate that.
===
 Well we left ours in MonicaÂs bedroom.
Nope, got it and I got yours  too. 
===
Hey Joe whatÂs up?
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. YÂknow, everywhere I look sheÂs likeÂ 
===
I can see why thatÂs hard to resist.
I like her so much!
===
Aw, IÂm sorry sweetie that she doesnÂt feel the same way.
I know. And sheÂs so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
===
Well they said I should bring someone.  Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Totally! I would love to spend New YearÂs with you.
===
Bye Janine!
Did she just ask me out on a date?
===
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, IÂm sorry, but I donÂt think that was a romantic thing.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. WeÂre going to a New YearÂs Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! YÂknow? But if she says ÂDude, what the hell are you doing?Â I can say ÂIt wasnÂt me, it was New Years!Â
===
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
===
Hey! YouÂre a good dancer!
Really?
===
Yeah, well youÂd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
What do you mean?
===
ThatÂs it, feel the rhythm. ThatÂs better.
Uh-huh.
===
 Okay, youÂre dancing with that girl over there.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
===
I donÂt see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! 
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
===
SheÂs nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown Â IÂm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
===
No I donÂt think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, sheÂs real, uh, mellow!
===
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you knowÂ
===
No, no. SheÂs fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Alright, alright, hey yÂknow fair is fair,  if youÂre right, youÂre right, what can I say, but hey oh no! 
===
God! What are you, in second grade?
Hey, now youÂre the one who wet his pants. 
===
WhatÂs going on over here?
Uh, take a look at the guyÂs pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but donÂt you think he went a little overboard?
===
WhatÂs the matter with you? Get out of here!
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
===
Alright weÂre back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! 
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
===
Cut!
No! Year! Happy No Year!
===
Joey.
Yeah?
===
 3, 2, 1.  Happy New Year.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
===
Well, I donÂt know tonight when they yelled cut and we didnÂt get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
===
In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
===
Sure, New YearÂs Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.
===
Me neither.
3, 2, 
===
Joey, you donÂt have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
===
Hey!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
===
SheÂs made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldnÂt get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!
===
You kissed her.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
===
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
I came over here to tell you guys.
===
I gotta go.
Okay. 
===
IÂm gonna be really late for dance class!
Okay. 
===
Okay, now IÂm really late. 
Okay, IÂm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? 
===
Bye. 
Have you kissed her yet? ItÂs awesome! I could do it forever! YÂknow what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
===
Rach, Phoebe hates 
too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
===
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
 I was tired!
===
ItÂs gotta be one of a kind. YÂknow like umm, yÂknow uh, whatÂs that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Hey! I made that for her!
===
You made pottery?
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
===
Yeah.
And Chandler I canÂt believe I let you pay for this one.  Thanks man.
===
Oh that would be great!
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
===
Joey, you donÂt have too!
Nope-op! I insist!  You get the wine right?
===
Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.
See ya tomorrow!
===
How are we gonna get out of that one?
What?
===
I canÂt handle two nights in a row with them.
What-whatÂs wrong with Monica and Chandler?
===
I donÂt know, theyÂre just a little blah!
Blah?!
===
Well yÂknow, heÂs blah, sheÂs justÂsheÂs very loud for such a small person.
Uh, theyÂre like my best friends. Are you saying we canÂt hang out with them? ÂCause that would kinda be a problem.
===
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just yÂknow, not two nights in a row. Okay?
I guess.
===
Thank you. 
If you want, IÂll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
===
Hey!
Hi!
===
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnÂt afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually itÂs just gonna be me again tonight.
===
What happened to Janine?
Oh, sheÂs uh-uh really sick.
===
Oh thatÂs too bad.
Yeah, sheÂs been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problemÂ Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
===
 Monica! Chandler! IÂm really-really sorry about tonight. I donÂt know if Joey told you; I just couldnÂt get out of going to this play. IÂm sorry. Have a great time.
ÂKay!
===
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Uh, yÂknow, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
===
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well uh, she didnÂt want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. IÂm so sorry.
===
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
===
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, donÂt-donÂt be mad. IÂm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! YÂknow? And it was our first date! Plus, sheÂs really sick!
===
No, you shÂNo you said you made that up!!
I know, but donÂt you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
===
Eh, theyÂre both good. I generally just go with, MonicaÂs drunk again.  
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? SheÂll come around I promise.
===
like that woman!
 I can hear you!
===
 I know!!!
 Hey!
===
Hey.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
===
Oh nothing, weÂre just talking. YÂknow, blah-blah-blah.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
===
Well, IÂd like to but,  IÂm not sure we have time to go.
Ha-ha, very funnyÂLook! I donÂt know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
===
We owe you?!
ThatÂs right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
===
We didnÂt give you any money! 
You donÂt think I know that!
===
Oh good.
Oh well then, good night!
===
 All right! You and me! LetÂs go! Right now!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!  You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! 
===
 YouÂd better hope I donÂt see you in the hallway!! 
All right, uh, weÂve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you canÂt treat them that way.
===
They said stuff to me too, yÂknow!
I know! I know! And IÂm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. TheyÂ TheyÂre like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-IÂ I donÂt think we can be together. It just, it just canÂt work. It canÂt.  IÂm very upset.
===
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. 
===
Did you hear that?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
===
Yeah, IÂm sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
Yeah! 
===
Hey!
How ya doinÂ?
===
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Pretty much, yeah.
===
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Well, when itÂs not right, you know it.
===
You okay?
Yeah! Yeah. IÂll be all right.
===
YÂknow what would cheer you up?
What?
===
IÂm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
 YouÂre right! That did cheer me up!
===
Yeah, I guess.
 Hey guys.
===
ItÂs my joke.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
===
Nah, MonicaÂs watching some cooking show. Come on, I donÂt want to miss when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, yÂknow what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
===
Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havenÂt really paid the bill
===
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. 
===
 All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Sure.
===
 Paid your phone bill?
Not so much.
===
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but IÂm not even sure I got it.
===
 Here you go.
Ah, Gunther, I canÂt pay for this right now because IÂm not working, so IÂve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payinÂ for stuff.
===
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I donÂt know. Ya see, itÂs just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yÂknow? And to go from that to this, I justÂ Plus, IÂd have to wait on all my friends.
===
Okay, but the moneyÂs good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
===
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
===
Uh, yeah, IÂll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Sure.  Coffee? ÂCause IÂm going up there. 
===
No, thank you.
 You guys need anything, Âcause IÂm heading up there. 
===
IÂd love an ice water.
You got it.
===
Joey, what are you doing?
Just being friendly. 
===
Joey, honey, I donÂt think youÂre supposed to go back there.
Nah, itÂs okay. Right, Gunther? 
===
DonÂt wink at me. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I donÂt see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. 
===
Joey, do you work here?
No.
===
Hey, waiter.
Yeah?
===
Joey, whatÂs going on. What didnÂt you tell us you work here?
ItÂs kind of embarrassing, yÂknow. I mean, I was an actor and now IÂm a waiter. ItÂs supposed to go in the other direction.
===
So is your apron. YouÂre wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the jobÂs easy and the moneyÂs good, you know? I guess IÂm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
===
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Okay, I guess it doesnÂt seem that weird.
===
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still havenÂt gotten it.
See, now itÂs weird again.
===
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  A smile goes a long way.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. YÂknow? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. ItÂs all about turnover.
===
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, IÂm sorry, Ross. IÂll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, IÂll toss in a free muffin.
===
No, IÂm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, itÂs a great part. Look, check it out. IÂm the lead guyÂs best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ÂIÂm sorry, that seatÂs saved.Â
===
Okay, IÂll see you in an hour.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ÂIÂm sorry, that seat is taken.Â
===
Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didnÂt mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
===
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So, youÂd hire me, right?
===
For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. 
===
Hey, buddy boy, howÂd the audition go?
Not good, no. I didnÂt get the part, and I lost my job here, so Â
===
How-how did you lose your job here?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
===
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youÂve been working here two days? ThatÂs not, thatÂs not right.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
===
ThatÂs right, he can have his job back. IÂm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
ThatÂs great. Thanks Rach.
===
No way. 
IÂm not answering that.
===
Hi!
Hi!
===
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh thatÂs on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
===
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, heÂs not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with himÂHe says itÂs okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
===
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isnÂt free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! IÂm getting more dates than ever!
===
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
How about a scone on the house baby?
===
And thatÂs Phoebe , and thatÂs Joey.
Hey,  how you doinÂ?
===
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
What?!
===
For all the free food you gave away.
Well if itÂs free food, how come youÂre charging me for it?
===
We donÂt give anything away unless itÂs someoneÂs birthday.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
===
No!
 Sorry! 
===
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
ItÂs just I canÂt because my manager said IÂ   "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear AnnieÂ
===
Amy!
 "ÂAmy! Happy birthday to you!"
===
Hey, thatÂs weird, todayÂs my birthday too!
Yeah, not it here it isnÂt.
===
YouÂre paying for that.
What? No-no itÂs her birthday!
===
YouÂve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it reallyÂ
===
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damnit! 
===
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all weÂve been through, I justÂyÂknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
 Oh-ho, and mine!
===
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didnÂt know we could date your sister!
===
Yuck!
I canÂt believe Ross went out with RachelÂs sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
===
That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
===
JoeyÂ
You wanna make it 6?!
===
No, I guess I just never really cried. YÂknow? IÂm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on man thereÂs gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
===
IÂd be sad sure, but I wouldnÂt cry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
===
No! Look, I donÂt cry! ItÂs not a big deal! Okay?!
No! ItÂs not okay! ItÂs not okay at all!! YouÂre dead inside!!
===
YouÂre just saying that because youÂre my biggest fan.   Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?  HeÂs a fan.  Bye! 
huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
===
I have no idea what youÂre talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe BuffayÂs autograph!
Oh, youÂre PhoebeÂs fan!
===
Oh yeah! IÂve seen all her movies.
Movies?
===
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
 I donÂt think so.
===
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store arenÂt gonna believe this! 
Hey Gunther, donÂt let that guy in here anymore! He just said PhoebeÂs a porn star!
===
 Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I donÂt think itÂs the kind youÂre gonna like.
===
Guys, whatÂs going on?
 PhoebeÂs a porn star!
===
ThatÂs Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
===
Yes, but you are dead inside.
All right well, IÂd better take that back.
===
Wh-what, why?
We canÂt watch that! I mean thatÂs Phoebe!
===
Probably just the first half.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! PhoebeÂs our friend! Well, IÂm not gonna watch it!
===
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Yeah.
===
SheÂs just doing her job!
 You sick bastards!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Oh no, not you too!
===
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe BuffayÂs checks; there were a lot of them.
Nice!
===
I wonÂt have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
ThatÂs great, but isnÂt it gonna bother that people still think youÂre a porn star?
===
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
You do?
===
Yeah.   YouÂre trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, IÂll give you a hint. From porn! Okay?  Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!  See?
Yeah.
===
Wow!
is the matter with you?!
===
No! Barry and Mindy.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-whoÂs Barry and Mindy?
===
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ohh-oh, wasnÂt he cheating on you with her?
===
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadnÂt realized she was a lesbian.
 I canÂt. I keep seeing it the good way.
===
Yeah. YÂknow, the hazelnut actually not a nut, itÂs a seed.
 Wow!!
===
Can anyone else name a well known seed thatÂs been masquerading as a nut?
Oh dear God, let me think. 
===
 Hey.
Hey.
===
Was his question whatÂs more boring than him?
thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
===
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?
===
Maybe Joey doesnÂt have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
ThatÂs an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
===
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
ThatÂs great! That would be great! LetÂs do that!
===
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
===
Okay!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I donÂt need any assistance in there, take a break!
===
 Hi!
 Hi!
===
 Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill youÂ
Well, itÂs always nice to meet the fans.
===
Ah!
 SheÂs not crazy is she?
===
No.
 So uh, how you doinÂ?
===
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!  Go!! WhoÂs this?  Oh okay, youÂre gonna like working for me. WhatÂs your name?  What kind of name is Brendy? IÂ WhateverÂ Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
 Hey there you are!
===
Uh-oh, itÂs my boss!
All right, hereÂs a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work IÂm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! 
===
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "IÂm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "IÂm lost and I canÂt find food."
 Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
===
Yeah! SheÂs right in there! 
Oh great.   Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
===
Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
===
 Wow! Umm, yÂknow, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldnÂt.
Why?  Why canÂt the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
===
 IsnÂt that a line from the show?!
Uh, yeah but uh,  I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
===
ThatÂs a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
===
 Here you go Joe, hereÂs the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. 
Thanks!  Yeah, thereÂs pulp in that. 
===
Yeah?
I thought we talked about this. I donÂt like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnÂt juice. All juice, okay?
===
IÂm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Oh my God, IÂm sorry, IÂm being so rude.  Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
===
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
 Iced tea.
===
Okay, anything for you sir?
 Did I not just tell him?
===
 Yes, you did.
 Okay look, Chandler, if this  you have got to listen!   YouÂre gonna throw that juice at me, arenÂt ya?
===
Okay!!
 Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know youÂre mad, but I just want to say IÂm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! YÂknow? I mean, yÂknow how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
===
mayonnaise!!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say IÂm sorry. Here.  
===
WhatÂs this?
pulp! Just the way you like it.
===
Comics!
Oh my God! ThatÂs great! Congratulations! WhatÂs the story?!
===
Oh you wouldnÂt uh, care. ItÂs just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
===
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesnÂt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistÂas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that canÂt have lumps in them.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ÂCause I think I read it!
===
Ohh, I mean itÂs just so realistic!
I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
===
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! 
 Do you uh, do youÂready for a refill?
===
Oh, I probably shouldnÂtÂso I will!  Oh! Wow! ItÂs like itÂs raining!
Pretty cool, huh? But if youÂre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnÂt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youÂd be wrong.
===
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
ItÂs uh, right through there. 
===
Okay.  God yÂknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey TribbianiÂs apartmentÂ
Yeah, lifeÂs pretty great isnÂt it?
===
Joey, youÂre such an amazing actor!  How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
===
Wow! Tell me something JoeyÂÂWhoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Yeah you did.
===
Okay.  
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
===
Yeah?
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
===
Wow! I canÂt, I canÂt feel my hands.
Come, come here. 
===
 Oh right.
Yeah.
===
 Oh God. Oh I canÂt believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
===
Noo! Oh God we didÂwe didnÂt, we didnÂt uhhÂ
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
===
God IÂm just a horrible person.
Wh-why?
===
Because IÂm married. ThatÂs right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV starÂs apartment to have an affair! Uck!
ThatÂs ridiculous! IÂm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
===
Yeah and IÂm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave meÂ
===
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Wow! Uh okay, well uhÂ 
===
 Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Sure! As long as they donÂt find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
===
But I thought that ring stood for CapriceÂs undying love for her brother.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Look at you! YouÂre up!
All right!
===
I thought IÂd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? IÂll be back soon.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! YouÂre not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
===
Hey Joe didÂ Did you ever have a threesome?
 Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think CarolÂs great and IÂm sure youÂre a very attractive man, but IÂ.
===
No! The reason IÂm asking is thatÂ I sorta had one last night.
You?
===
Yeah!
Wow!
===
Yeah!
All right! So, was it amazing?
===
It was, it was okay.
Just okayÂDid you do it right?!
===
Look, itÂs just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would 
Huh. But still Ross, youÂre worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! YÂknow what I mean?
===
ItÂs just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
===
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Not the other one?
===
No, she kept kicking me away!
Yeah, you donÂt want that.
===
No!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
===
of stuff!
You got a little bored?
===
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Yeah? What did ya have?
===
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustardÂ
Sounds good.
===
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
 Hey! So, whatÂs with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
===
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
YÂknow whatÂs more generous than that?! Fifty percent! YÂknow whatÂs even more generous than that?!!
===
WhatÂs up with the greed Joe?
All right, look IÂm sorry you guys, but itÂs just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And theyÂre really expensive, yÂknow? IÂm down to like three! Well, actually two Âcause one of Âem I kinda blackened in some teethÂWhy did I do that?! 
===
Oh, wait! Wait! DonÂt you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe youÂll get that job!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
===
 Ah, finally an explanation.
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? LetÂs see uh, well I donÂt want to donate sperm again.  I really prefer doing that at the home office yÂknow?  Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
===
 Joey!
Yeah?
===
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while youÂre working?
Uhh do it?
===
That guy  has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! HeÂs complained about you three times! 
Well, where was I? 
===
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Takes it out of you? 
===
 She was working on ValentineÂs Day so weÂre celebrating it tonight.
Ohh, hey! Why donÂt you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
===
Ooh, Joey, thatÂs actually a really good idea!
And of course, crotchless panties. 
===
You guys!
You canÂt make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cutÂ
===
WeÂre actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so weÂre not looking for applicants right now.
Oh thatÂs too bad. IÂve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure thereÂs no studies I can participate in?
===
Well, hereÂs a schedule of whatÂs coming up. 
Thanks.  Well but this one starts now. 
===
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. ItÂs a twins study. 
But itÂs $2,000.
===
Sorry.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
===
Who the hell are you?!
IÂm Joey! How are you doinÂ?!
===
Who the hell is Carl?!
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
===
YÂknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arenÂt they?
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. YÂknow? The only problem is, CarlÂs acting isÂ 
===
 Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
 Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! 
===
fiasco.
ThatÂs right! And what are you not gonna do?
===
Well, IÂm not gonna talk becauseÂ
 Damnit Carl! 
===
  Can I have the next one please?  Joey and Tony Tribbiani. 
ThatÂs us.
===
 But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
ThatÂs right, $2,000.
===
But, youÂre not identical twins.
Damnit Carl!
===
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
===
Yeah.
Oh, Âcause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, thereÂs your admirer. 
===
Besides, thereÂs a big age difference.
Oh, well think of it like this, when youÂre 90Â
===
I know when IÂm 90 sheÂll be like 80 and it wonÂt seem like such a big difference.
No thatÂs not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when youÂre 90 youÂll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
===
ItÂs ChandlerÂs way of pretending he didnÂt take mime.
Oh well listen, anyway sheÂs directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
===
Oh, I donÂt know man. I havenÂt talked to her in like ten years.

===

Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
===

The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
===
My God! 
 Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
===
God, itÂs great to catch up! I canÂt believe how long itÂs been!
Chandler, is thatÂ 
===
 Oh thatÂs great! Good for you.
Hey-hey listenÂ 
===
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together ummÂ  Can you hold for one second please?  What?!
When youÂre off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
===
 Hi! IÂm back.  Yeah, that sounds great.  Okay. Well, weÂll do it then.  Okay, bye-bye. 
Hey listen, so whenÂs-whenÂs my audition? I mean I know itÂs Thursday, but what time?
===
 We didnÂt get to the audition. IÂm gonna take her to coffee and then weÂll do it then.
Ah-ha!
===
All right, well why donÂt I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. 
===
WhatÂs that smell?
I know! 
===
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean whatÂs more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
===
 Hey.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
===
I couldnÂt do it.
You couldnÂt do it?!
===
Joey! You didnÂt even know her!
Ah whatever!
===
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
No thatÂs all right. DonÂt worry about it.
===
Oh but look! ThatÂs gonna leave a stain! 
Rach! Hey! ItÂs fine! YouÂre at JoeyÂs!
===
Really?

That refrigerators donÂt live as long as people.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, IÂll take a check for the other hundred.
===
YouÂre jokinÂ right?
Of course IÂm jokinÂ! I donÂt take checks.
===
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. 
Oh, IÂm sorry. Thank you Chandler.

So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Ooh! So close.
===
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! YÂknow, a box of 
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, howÂs it going with her?
===
Hey.
Huh.
===
Well, youÂdonÂt look good Joe.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesÂHey, what was in that brown jar?
===
ThatÂs still in there?!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
===
Is this a service youÂre providing me?
No! No! No! For my new fridgeÂour new fridge!

All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
===
Uh-huh.
I still havenÂt gotten a check for your half yet.
===

IÂm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
===
Okay now it doesnÂt matter which one you choose, yÂknow? ItÂs completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
 Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
===
Okay sure!
Really?!
===
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Call it even?
===
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girlÂs bodies, waking up next to people you donÂt even knowÂ
time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
===
You know the hotels?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break Â81! Woo-hoo!
===
In 1981 you were 13!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And yÂknow who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
===
I wanna say a disease.
 Hey!
===
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
===
YouÂve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I wonÂt leave you!
===
DonÂt worry about me, IÂm a robot! IÂm just a machine!!
No youÂre not! Not to me!
===
 Oh my God.
What?
===
talented!
Yeah, youÂre great! Okay, letÂs take it fromÂ
===
 No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
===
Oh yeah, youÂre solid. Yeah, youÂre just no me.
YÂknow what? I think thatÂs enough for now. Yeah. I donÂt want to be over rehearsed.
===
 So uh, whatÂs this thing youÂre auditioning for?
Oh, itÂs a new TV show. Yeah. IÂm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, IÂm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. HeÂs a, heÂs a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
===
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
ThatÂs the title! Yeah! YÂknow they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
===
HuhÂWait so Joey if you get this, youÂre gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean youÂll be like the Big Cheese!  Or the Big MacÂHey! You 
Well, donÂt get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
===
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just donÂt know if IÂm good enough.
===
Joey, what are you talking about? YouÂre a terrific actor.
You really think so?
===
Oh, are we playing this?!
 Hey.
===
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didnÂt go well but it really did go well?
Yeah, did I fool ya?
===
So it did go well.
well!
===
Oh thatÂs great!
Yeah-yeah, itÂs down to me and two other guys.
===
Wow!
And I know both of them, theyÂre really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials whoÂs always getting chased by those big flowersÂ
===
I doing?
IÂm just so nervous! YÂknow? The callback isnÂt until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
===
Look, donÂt worry. Okay? YouÂre gonna be fine.
ThereÂs just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I donÂt know if youÂd understand.
===
You mean you didnÂt get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
===
Well, maybe we can fix it yÂknow? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldÂve turned my whole career around!
===
I messed up. Okay? IÂm sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you donÂt even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
===
Look, IÂm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youÂre not perfect! YouÂve made some errors in judgment too!
Name one!
===
 What happened?!!
 Awww, man! He promised he wouldnÂt take the chairs!!
===
What?
No way!Â  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
===
Cupping.
That's how they do pants!Â  Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
===
Oh my God!Â  
wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
===
Please tell me you got the message!
What message?
===
The actor playing Mac couldnÂt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oÂclock.
What?! ItÂs 6 oÂclock!
===
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to RossÂs! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
I canÂt believe this Chandler!
===
Sorry! I-I-I donÂt know what to say.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
===
 Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, well IÂm uhÂ
===
YÂknow, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh wow! Okay man, IÂm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
===
Well thatÂs good. Because you didnÂt! And IÂm incredibly happy for ya!!
 ThatÂs mean! You really had me going there!
===
Oh, we could do this all day.
Yeah, youÂre right. Okay look, listen, letÂs talk about what a huge star IÂm gonna be!
===
are gonna be a huge star! IÂm gonna hug ya!
You hug me!
===
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Yeah.
===
 I canÂt! My circuits are fried! TheyÂre fried I tell you!!
Wow!  Well then IÂll just have to carry you.
===
ThatÂll be a neat trick, when youÂre,  when youÂre dead!
Ross, you donÂt have to yell.
===
Oh my God. I meanÂ
YÂknow what? I think thatÂs enough for today. Thanks for your help! 
===
Oh thatÂs right. ItÂs your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? IÂve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
===
No! Joey, youÂre going to be great!
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I donÂt know anything about technology! I canÂt even use ChandlerÂs computer except to find porn! And-and thatÂs only Âcause itÂs right there when you turn it on!
===
 So uh, hereÂs your office set!
Wow! Huh?  Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
===
 LetÂs get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
===
IÂm sorry, why donÂt we do that right now? HeÂs right here. 
Okay.
===
Joey Tribbiani, this isÂ
Oh wow! HeÂs so lifelike!  Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guyÂs ears.
===
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
 How do you do there, Wayne? 
===
IÂll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? 
Okay. Sorry about thatÂ Uh, so whereÂs C.H.E.E.S.E.?
===
 Nice to meet you Mac!
 This is like the temporary robot, right?
===
No. Why?
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, yÂknow? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
===
I spent two years developing this machine, itÂs absolutely state of the art.
IÂm sorry, it justÂI donÂt know it doesnÂt really look like it can do anything.
===
How was your first day?
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
===
Well, why donÂt you just get him fired?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but IÂm the star! YÂknow? ThereÂs a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.  Excuse me.  Joey Tribbiani. 
===
 Joe! IÂm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Wow!
===
The thing is itÂs kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesnÂt know he might be fired. ItÂs the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
IÂm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
===
Well yÂknow Joey, youÂre a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
===
No sweetie, youÂve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! YouÂve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
ThatÂs not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow IÂm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. 
===
DonÂt touch him!
Okay!  All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy!  Ah-ah!!  Okay, thatÂs why you didnÂt want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay?  Stupid! I canÂt believe it! God!   Hey, how you doinÂ? 
===
Oh IÂm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
===
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah? Well, I donÂt want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. 
===
Joey, Joey, I-I-IÂll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
 Why should I help you?!
===
 The reason he just said.
 What do you need?
===
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yÂknow Sarah? 
Yeah?
===
I wish I could talk to her.
What are you in love with her or something?
===
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Oh wow Wayne, itÂs not really something you can teach yÂknow? ItÂs pretty much something youÂre born with if youÂÂYou-you can teach it! IÂll show you right how to do it.
===
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
You got it! And the rabbiÂs beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!  ItÂs your line C.H.E.E.S.E.!  Wayne! Wayne!!
===
Well itÂs justÂitÂs one of those situations that I just hate. YÂknow? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
 Now youÂre thinking you gotta sleep with him.
===
IÂll give up my ticket.
Me too.
===
ItÂs mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh man! 
===
Hey!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
===
Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall!  Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?  Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, IÂm ready to go back up on the wall IÂm the star of a new TV show.
===
(picking up a 
Oh well, itÂs not on TV yet.
===
Well, then itÂs not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? 
===
I did.
All right, letÂs get me back up there! 
===
No! It donÂt go up on the wall!
WhatÂBut you saw the show!
===
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Dry cleaners?
===
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
===
ThatÂs right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-thatÂs offensive to Russians.
===
IÂve never seen it!
Oh you should, itÂs great.
===
Can I help you?
Uh yeah, where-whereÂs the guy who decides whoÂs pictures go up on the wall?
===
HeÂs not here right now.
Oh, youÂre kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? IÂm an actor; IÂm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
===
YÂknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there. 
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  YouÂre the other one right? 
===
Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" 
I didnÂt do that! Who wouldÂve done that?!
===
Joey!
go out with your wife!  Okay? I went out with her! 
===
Well, we should go.
Yeah.
===
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there  wants the biscotti. 
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
===
Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago.  Did I forget to you that one? IÂm sorry.
===
Oh thatÂs cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Great! 
===
How rude.
Oh, IÂm sorry. You wanna bite? 
===
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
No.
===
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Yeah.
===
Okay. Well, apparently ChandlerÂs angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, weÂre supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
===
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yÂknow? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
still have his credit card.
===
Oh.  
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  YÂknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justÂI donÂt get Chandler. YÂknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you donÂt get all upset.
===
All the time?
All the time!
===
Okay! 
 Hey!
===
Joey! 
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!  Hi, Paul is it? 
===
Do you have my credit card?
Yes, itÂs in myÂ InÂin my pocket.   My back pocket! My back pocket!
===
Thank God! 
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
===
Oh, I canÂt go.
Come on! ItÂll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, andÂ Paul probablyÂ
===
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
No! He blew us off!
===
What?!
I know!
===
I canÂt believe it.  Can I tell you something? IÂm a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
===
YÂknow what? He didnÂt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we donÂt talk to him 
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
===
ThatÂs right!
I like it!
===
Eh? WeÂll show him!
From now on, itÂs gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.  Okay! WeÂre gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
===
Guys?  IÂve got something important to tell ya.  Guys?  Guys?!  IÂm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
 I think we gotta end the freeze out.
===
Yeah, check out the ring. 
Oh my God!!
===
You-youÂre gonna get married?! I meanÂ WeÂre gonna be brothers-in-law! 
And-and-and-and-and-and, and weÂre gonna be friends again! 
===
 HeyyyyÂWhat?
Oh itÂs water under the bridge, forget it!
===
Okay!  I was gonna wait Âtil uh, it was official yÂknow? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youÂre my best friends.
I think IÂm gonna cry!
===
I know.
 WhereÂs all the tissues?! 
===
Yeah!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
===
OhhÂ
That sounds perfect!
===
Yeah.
YouÂre gonna mess it up let me do it.
===
Hey!
Hey Rach!
===
I just get mad when Rachel doesnÂt remember where weÂre going.
Where are you going?
===
I can do that for the kids.
Hey, yÂknow what? IÂll come too. IÂm making money now; itÂs about time I give something back.
===
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Okay. Have a benefit.
===
Uh-uhÂWow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesnÂt really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, IÂm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
ThatÂs not what she said last night. 
===
you marry me?  Hey, you marry me!  WhatÂs going on little elves?
ItÂs the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
===
And I also brought my friend JoeyÂ
 Oh!! Shrimp toast! 
===
Hey you guys! Look! 
Hey!
===
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentlemanÂs day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! 
I won! That was my guess!
===
What?! What?! What?!
I guessed 20,000!
===
Joey! It is an auction! You donÂt guess, you buy!
What?! I donÂt have 20,000!
===
were you thinking?!
I didnÂt know it was an auction!
===
Wh?!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
===
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
I donÂt know! Charity?
===
 Mr. Tribbiani.
Oh hi!
===
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
===
I think it was valued at 19,000
 Hey, I was pretty close.  Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I canÂt buy the boat, I donÂt have any money.
===
 Hey! YouÂcanÂtÂleave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I donÂt have that kind of money!
===
I know. Okay.  Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what weÂre gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then youÂre just gonna pay the difference.
Okay.
===
Okay.
Look, I donÂt know why the kids need a youth center anyway! YÂknow? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
===
Oh great!
 Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
===
ThatÂs me.
Ahh, yes. 
===
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
You-you have to pay that! ItÂs not just a guess.
===
OhhÂ
Are you kidding me?! SheÂs gonna this boat!
===
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Aw-awww!
===
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
OoooohÂ
===
What the hell, itÂs for a good cause! All right!
No way! ItÂs mine!!
===
 What?! What?!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
===
But Joey you donÂt have $20,000!
Who cares?! I-IÂll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
===
I wanna see whatÂs in your hand. I wanna see the trash. 
Yeah.
===
Richard was there so I couldnÂt do it!
What?! NooooÂ 
===
IÂm gonna do it tomorrow yÂknow, and-and surprise her, but now youÂve ruined it!
We didnÂt ruin it!
===
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctorÂ
salesman!
===
I can do that, IÂve had 30 years of practice.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! 
===
 I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
That guyÂs still doing that?!
===
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnÂt want to get married?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
===
 Hi guys!
Hey!
===
Oh, just hanging out, talkinÂ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
 Yeah, Big Brother.
===
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
===
Yeah, itÂs great.
Whoa-whoa, whatÂs the matter?! Talk to the captain!
===
IÂm just having one of those days where you realize youÂre in a dead-end relationship!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
===
ItÂs not like I want to get married tomorrow! ItÂs just that I-IÂd like to believe that IÂm in a relationship thatÂs actually going somewhere, that IÂm not just wasting my time!
Well, you know Chandler.
===
No I donÂt know Chandler! Not anymore! ItÂs like itÂs like somethingÂs changed.
Maybe you changed?
===
I didnÂt change!
Maybe thatÂs the problem.
===
What?!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
===
Is that some kind of boat talk?
I donÂt know!  I havenÂt totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
===
What does he think? Does he think IÂm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
===
 Well thereÂs some people who do want to marry me.
There are?
===
Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and ChandlerÂs tellinÂ ya how much he hates marriage?!
===
ThatÂs right.
marriage!!
===
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that heÂs a-a complex fellow whoÂs unlikely to take a wife! That-that heÂs against marriage and always will be!
from what I said?!
===
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
===
What?!
Yeah! Yeah, IÂve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnÂt keep flying off!
===
MyÂOh my God!
I know! They suck!!
===
HeÂs not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! IÂm supposed to do that!
I know!
===
YouÂre right.
Yeah!
===
Okay.  IÂm gonna get the ring! IÂm gonna get the ring!  IÂm gonna go find her and  IÂm just going to propose!
Okay.
===
Okay great.
Dude-dude-dude!
===
What?!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
===
What?!
 Hey!
===
 Hey!
Phoebe! WeÂre both  your backup?!
===
Phoebe you canÂt have both of them! You have to pick one!
Pick me!!
===
All right well letÂs see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boatÂThis is hard!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
===
Okay, yÂknow what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what weÂre gonna do! IÂm gonna write Joey on one napkin  and IÂm gonna right Ross on the other napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Okay thatÂs fair.
===
Yeah absolutely! 
Yeah.
===
I canÂt talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
SheÂs gone.
===
What?
SheÂs gone. She had a bag and she left.
===
What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
===
Well why didnÂt you stop her?! Why didnÂt you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnÂt believe me.
===
Well whereÂ Where did she go?
To her parentÂs I think and she said you shouldnÂt call her. But if I were you I would.
===
I canÂt believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry man.
===
Oh hell, heÂs done this three times! He knows what its about!
Yeah!
===
I found a note on my door, "Come to MonicaÂs quick, bring champagne and a 
 Yeah IÂll take that.
===
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
You guys donÂt think I look 19?
===
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that. 
===
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
===
Young! YouÂre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodyÂs ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Wow thanks! 
===
Joe?
Yeah!
===
Uhh, youÂve had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
===
Well, itÂs just the reason that IÂm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toÂI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnÂtÂ. There huhÂhmm, there-there was an incident.
DonÂt worry about that man, that happens.
===
ItÂs happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
===
Well, whatÂd you do?
I did it anyway.
===
What a great night, Chandler canÂt do it, these guys kissedÂ 
What? 
===
What?!
You guys kissed! Oh myÂthis is huge!
===
Well yeah, that and ChandlerÂs problem.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
===
Yes that would be lovely.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
===
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Really?
===
Yes!
Seriously?
===
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
 IÂm 30!
===
Joey, you are not! YouÂre 31.
 Aww crap!
===
No-no, I-I really donÂt want to talk about it! I donÂt!  Especially with you. 
Psss, that is whack!
===
 Yeah?  Okay, I think IÂll play it at the wedding.
Yeah! Well, I think weÂll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you donÂt."
===
Well, I donÂt think Monica is gonna take this away.
WouldnÂt she?
===
Would she?
Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
===
YÂknow, I donÂt really their permission.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
===
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then youÂ You gotta do something about your eyes.
What?! WhatÂs wrong with my eyes.
===
They give you away! ThereÂs just-thereÂs just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
And thatÂll get rid of my wisdom?
===
Hi!
Who wants French toast?
===
Oh, IÂll have some!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
===
Well, you couldnÂt get them anyway. Ian doesnÂt plan anymore and DerrickÂ  And Derrick is a name I shouldnÂt know.
 Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  YÂknow, something a little snugglyer?
===
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, the duckÂ
===
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
===
Uh-huh!
let me nap! Ugh, IÂm gonna get cranky!
===
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
one of the places the duck got sick!
===
What?!
All right, IÂm gonna go! 
===
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
eat your face cream!
===
Hey Joey, what Âcha doing?
SweepinÂ. Why? Turn you on?
===
No.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
===
Joey,  where did you learn that word?
Where do you think,  Zelda?
===
 You found my book?!
Yeah I did!
===
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Okay, look IÂm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnÂt have, but you got porn!
===
Hey-hey, yÂknow what? I donÂt care! IÂm not ashamed of my book. ThereÂs nothing with a woman enjoying a littleÂerotica. ItÂs just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. 
You got porn!
===
 Joey.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
===
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
No-no-no, IÂm serious. You donÂt smell it? SomethingÂs on fire.
===
Well no, I donÂt smell anything.
Oh, yÂknow what? ItÂs probably just your burninÂ loins.
===
He said he liked that!! Oh youÂre right, youÂre right. IÂm sorry.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
===
His daughter was hot.
Gotcha.
===
Who are you supposed to be?
The vicar!
===
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?
===
 Yeah. Look Joey, itÂs enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and itÂsÂIÂm notÂitÂs just not funny anymore!
All right, IÂm sorry. Rach IÂRach IÂm sorry. Okay? IÂm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. 
===
All right! YÂknow what? ThatÂs it! You wanna do it?! LetÂs do it!
Huh?
===
 ThatÂs right, I wanna do it with you! IÂve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
 I-I-I-I did? 
===
 Yeah! Ohh, IÂve been waitinÂ so long to get on that body!
This body? 
===
Yeah thatÂs right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-hey, youÂre startinÂ to sound like the butcherÂs wife there in-in chapter seven.
===
Yeah, what?
What?
===
Are you kidding? Okay, IÂll give you a hint; IÂll give you a hint. 
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. ChandlerÂs eyes!
===
Yeah-yeah, did-didnÂt you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of ummÂ
Feminine.
===
arenÂt they.
 Ahoy!
===
Hey! HowÂs the boat?!
Great! IÂm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
===
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
===
If you donÂt sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Oh, itÂs great! ItÂs a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. 
===
YÂknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
===
the Coast Guard. 
What are they doing out here? The coastÂs all the way over there. 
===
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? WeÂre not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.
===
Okay, IÂm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? LetÂs start sailing, and I want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!  Yo-ho-ho!
===
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, letÂs do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  whatÂs this called?
Uh, boat rope.
===
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Uhh, rub it?
===
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
IÂd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uhÂ
===
TimeÂs up, now your dead.
And deaf!
===
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! 
Yes.
===
DonÂt just say yes! This isnÂt a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
===
That and arrogance.
 Hey.
===
Hey! How was sailing?
I donÂt want to talk about it. YÂknow, you couldÂve at least saved me a whole cookie. 
===
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
 Women are mean!!! 
===
Thank you!
 Hey.
===
Well hello! So, when are we gettinÂ back out on the water matey? 
Oh uh, I donÂt know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
===
Why not?
Because! YouÂre mean on the boat!
===
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
===
Look Joey, IÂm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
===
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
===
Yeah, I didnÂt want you to get hit by the boom!
Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldÂve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
===
All right, yÂknow what? I-IÂm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
You wonÂt boss me around anymore?
===
I wonÂt boss you around.
And youÂll be nice?
===
And, IÂll be nice.
And youÂll be topless?
===
AndÂJoey!
Do you want me to learn?!
===
Okay Joey honey, youÂre doing really good! All right, now IÂm just gonna need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Ohh yeah.
===
Right?
Nope.
===
ItÂs left sweetie, but thatÂs okay sweetie, thatÂs a tough one.
I donÂt know why you just donÂt say left.
===
Okay, go to the left.  The left!
Huh?
===
 Just sit over there!! 
 Okay! Okay, youÂre yelling again! See that?
===
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Oh, yÂknow what? Since IÂm here, I think IÂm gonna have me a little beer on the port side. 
===
Okay Joey, weÂre luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? 
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnÂt know there.
===
Joey, come on! We just went over this! 
Oh, yÂknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
===
What do you mean you quit?! You canÂt quit!
Why not?!
===
Because youÂre not finished yet and I wonÂt have it! Greens do not quit!
Greens? IÂm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
===
Oh my God, wait did IÂI just said Greens donÂt quit didnÂt I?   Did I just say Greens donÂt quit?!
Yes! Yes! You did and youÂre still yelling at me!
===
No! No! No! IÂm not yelling at you, IÂm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh IÂm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! IÂve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this cominÂ. Oh, Joey, IÂm sorry. IÂm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Well, hey I did learn.
===
Really?
Yeah! Come on.
===
AwwwÂ
Yeah, itÂs okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
===
Left.
Damnit!
===
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why donÂt you give a pull on that rope? 
===
Ohh weÂre not sailing.
Just pull on it.
===
All right.  Hey-hey-hey!!  Sandwiches!
What else?
===
 Here you go.
Thank you.
===
Oh wow! 
What are you doing?
===
Ohh, sorry.
What youÂdonÂt hold it like that! YouÂre lettinÂ all the good stuff fall out.
===
ThatÂs nice.
 Mom, so what did you think? 
===
 Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! YouÂll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office andÂ
 You guys! You guys! YouÂre not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
===
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
===
Okay, so anyway IÂm sittinÂ in my office and guess who walks in.
IÂm gonna be on two TV shows!
===
Joey!
Oh, you werenÂt finished?
===
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story.  It was Ralph Lauren!  Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Uh Rach, if youÂre gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
===
ItÂs the same story.
 Wow, itÂs really long.
===
happy for you!
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
===
Oh hey!
IÂll be playing Drake RemorayÂs twin brother, Stryker!
===
Ahhh!!
 WellÂI got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
===
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Hey Terry!
===
Good to see you again!
ItÂs been a while, huh? Wow, itÂs funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
===
ItÂs a different building.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
===
Why donÂt we start right now!
Okay.
===
Here are the audition scenes. 
 Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
===
Why would you think that?
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, StrykerÂs twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
===
Everybody has to audition.
to do this. I got my own cable TV series,  with a robot.
===
Hi!
Hey.
===
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
===
IÂm sorry Joey.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
===
Well wait a minute, what happened to 
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
===
What happened?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
===
Joey, why would you do that?
Because they wanted me to audition!
===
Joey Tribbiani! IÂm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls!  I gotta go Joey.
Wait! Terry! WaitÂLookÂWait I-IÂ Look, IÂm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking IÂm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
===
I canÂt help you Joey.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
===
And cut!
 IÂm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
===
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uhh, well IÂve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt.  You got an extra one?
===
Yeah, I donÂt think so Joe.
All right, I guess this will be fine.
===
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
===
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? IÂll pay.
Huh, Rach I got to say itÂs gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
===
with him!
Really? ÂCause I could kinda use the money.
===
Joey, just-just he-heÂs new in town and I know he doesnÂt have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. IÂll really appreciate it.
Yeah, okay.
===
Yeah?
Sure, no problem.  OohÂHey, donuts!
===
Yeah!
Okay. 
===
I canÂt help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
===
Borrow money from me?
Okay, firstÂfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up.  See? All right, now you try. Look down , youÂre looking down, keep looking downÂ
===
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut. 
===
 Hi!
Hey!
===
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah! That guyÂs all right!
===
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
What?
===
YÂknow, all the women.
Hey well, you canÂt teach someone to be good with women. YÂknow, thatÂs why I never had any luck with Chandler.
===
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, itÂs justÂAnd I know heÂs my assistant and I canÂt date himÂbut it just bothers me, all right?!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you canÂt take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
===
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
 What?!
===
I just donÂt want him to meet anybody until I am over my crushÂAnd I will get over it. ItÂs-itÂs not like I love him, itÂs just physical! ButÂI mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
I know, Monica told me.
===
 So, will you talk to him?
I donÂt know Rach.
===
shirts.
One!  No ten! You said ten! You canÂt take that back!
===
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
I donÂt know. You uh, you got something for me?
===
Really?
Yeah, for you!
===
attractive couple. 
Yeah, we look great together.
===
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
YÂknow, we donÂt have to imagine.
===
IÂm marrying her.
WeÂll just see.
===
still great!
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
===
saw it!
And?
===
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
What are you talking about? Bitch.
===
What happened?!!
Well, I donÂt know!!
===
We fell asleep! That is all.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, IÂd better go.
===
I think that would be best.
Yeah. All right, IÂll talk to you later.
===
Okay. But not about this!
No! Never! Never!  Bye.
===
Phoebe is gonna be MonicaÂs maid of honor!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? 
===
Because I cared enough to lie!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youÂd handle maid of honor type situations.
===
What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if IÂm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
===
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
===
every bit as good as 
Hi.
===
Just uh, brought back your videos.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
===
No! No we donÂt!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! 
===
IÂ I donÂt know what you are talking about.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
===
IÂve had better.
Okay! When?!
===
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh!
===
IÂve said it! Okay?! But itÂs over Joey!
I want to do it again.
===
do it again.
Why not?
===
Because itÂs weird!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
===
Sure, what do you got?

===
No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
===
Because itÂs the highest.  Okay, Rachel youÂre up first.  Situation No. 1: YouÂre with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! 
 I donÂt want to marry Chandler!
===
Okay, uhÂ
IÂve got cold feet.
===
ÂitÂs gonna be okay!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I donÂt know if I can do it! This means IÂll never get to sleep with Joey!
===
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. YÂknow, itÂs-itÂs just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You donÂt get to keep the gifts.
 Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
===
Oh!
Okay, PhoebeÂ
===
Yes! Your honor?
WeÂre now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
===
Oh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
===
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, IÂve known them separately and IÂve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Wow.  Good speech.
===
Okay Phoebe, I guess youÂre next  although I really donÂt see the point.
Yeah.
===
 Rach, itÂs gonna be okay!  You guys are the best!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
===
Yeah?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.  
===
Why-why would I care about that?
No reason, IÂm just saying that uhÂ ThatÂs where IÂll be. 
===
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Pretty good.
===
Oh good.  Ahhh! My God, sorry! 
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; IÂm late for work.
===
What-what?! YouÂre gonna leave this person with me?!
YeahÂHey, donÂt worry, sheÂs a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that IÂm not looking for a serious relationship; thatÂd be great.
===
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, yÂknow lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, IÂm a lonerÂNo! An outlaw! Tell her she doesnÂt want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
===
YÂknow what? ThatÂs a lot to remember, canÂt I just tell her youÂre a pig?
Hey, IÂm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! HeÂd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, heÂd make extras and leave Âem for me.
===
Well forget it, IÂm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Fine!  Now, whereÂd we land on those pancakes? 
===
Hey!
Hey-hey, whoÂs your friend?  Hey!!
===
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still here!
===
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Why wouldnÂt ya? Erin is great! Then-then thereÂs you guys.
===
Bye Joey.  Last night was fun.
Yeah. IÂll uh, IÂll call ya.
===
And call me!
 Okay, good to see you again.
===
Bye.
Bye-bye.
===
We want you to marry her!
What?!!
===
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
===
Joey, sheÂs so cool. She speaks four languages.
know what guys want!
===
Look Joey, come on sheÂs so perfect for you! I mean sheÂs sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
My beers?! Look you guys, sheÂs a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I justÂI donÂt see it going anywhere.
===
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Look IÂm sorry you guys, I-I just donÂt think so.
===
Fine. 
Hey, donÂt start judging me!  Huh? YouÂre the one whoÂs in love with her assistant!  Huh? And you, youÂre the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
===
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think itÂs like uh-a thing!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
===
Oh for cryinÂ out loud! 
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
===
Well now whatÂs the rush?
I like to see the previews.  The candy.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Joey.
Erin.
===
Oh no.
 What party?
===
A birthday party.
WhoÂs birthday party?
===
AllisonÂs birthday party.
 Oh, and how is Allison?
===
 Wait a minute! Why donÂt you guys do something?!
 Yeah, look how that worked out.
===
How did it go with Erin?
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
===
Yay!! Oh so, youÂre not, youÂre not mad at us anymore?
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. YÂknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
===
DidnÂt you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well thatÂs aÂ
===
 Oh my God! Listen to you talkinÂ about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please donÂt get married before I do.
Okay.
===
What about Benitez?
What about Game 1 of the Series?
===
What about shut up?
You shut up!  I love arguing with her.  IÂll be right back. 
===
Oh well, I guess Italian isnÂt one of the four languages you speak.
 Hey! You wanna go?
===
Yeah, letÂs go.
Okay. See you guys later.
===
Yeah, see ya.
 Hey, thank you so much. 
===
So how was, how was your date?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but stillÂ And guess what, IÂm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
===
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! ItÂs a surprise, but itÂs gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
===
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, sheÂs not lookinÂ for a serious relationship.
Where are you gettinÂ this?
===
Well, she told me. She said sheÂs kinda a loner.
Oh. Oh.
===
JoeyÂ
No hey Rach, itÂs cool okay? YÂknow IÂm a loner too!  Right?
===
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell Âem youÂre not looking for a relationship.
No! No. DonÂt do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
===
Well that too.  Joey?
Yeah?
===
Do you want some pancakes?
 Finally!
===
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inÂvegetables, Joey? 
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. 
===
Wow, how many have you got? 
Fifty-six! 
===
What? That's impossible. 
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? 
===
You're on! 
 All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. 
===
 Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work? 
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 
===
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. 
===
Seriously, it's moving! 
What the hell is in there? 
===
What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
Yeah that dog left! 
===
Okay, it's umÂ
 Don't do it! 
===
Why? 
Told ya. 
===
 Okay, you are new!
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likinÂ ice cream. 
===
Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
Half hour. 
===
When it's your assistant, I would say never. 
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. 
===
Huh. A moo-point? 
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. 
===
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. 
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. 
===
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!  
 All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it! 
===
What? 
 Street noise drowned any of that out?  No, all right, I see you later, okay...  
===
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. 
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
===
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
===
And that doesn't scare you?  
Ross, you need some help? 
===
From you?  Yes, please! 
 First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
===
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you.  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out 
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. 
===
 Hi! 
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here! 
===
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! 
You think? 
===
Hey! What are you guys doing? 
Hey.
===
But we donÂt know the neighbors.
I do. ThereÂs uh, letÂs see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids IÂve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
===
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
===
They love my candy? Oh man!!! IÂve gotta go make more!! 
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightÂve happened to a huge chunk of it.
===
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
===
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about 
 Those two only had each other!
===
Oh yeah! I saw her walkinÂ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkinÂ it by the park.
===
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Hey Rach?
===
Yeah?
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? 
===
Ugh!
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
===
Please, canÂt you help me out?
 Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
===
WeÂre waiting for the candy.  Bring out the candy!
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
===
Joey!
WhatÂs up buddy?
===
What are you doing?
Waiting for candy.
===
No not  Candy Lady.
 Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
===
All right, yÂknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it! YouÂve ruined it! Go home! YouÂve ruined it! YouÂve ruined it!
ThatÂs right, itÂs all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!  
===
IÂm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
 Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I donÂt knowÂ 
===
 Hey!
Hey! Great, youÂre home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas! 
===
Drums?
 No! Drums!
===
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! YÂknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
===
Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you.
Thank you.   Hey Pheebs!
===
Hey!
Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.
===
Joey, yÂknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
===
 Hey, Joey, I got you another present. 
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?
===
What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! 
===
I got it!
 Is it back in the cage?
===
Its back in cage!
Cage closed?
===
SoÂ
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, itÂs just not my character thatÂs not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
===
Absolutely!
IÂll see you at 8:00.
===
Hey, yÂknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! 
 Hey!
===
Oh! HereÂs Joseph Francis!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
===
So what?! That doesnÂt give you the right to ditch me!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
===
I donÂt accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I canÂt just be a way to kill time Âtil you meet someone better! YÂknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!
Wow! IÂm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
===
Well, it does.
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? IÂm sorry.  How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! IÂll pay for myself!
===
Hey Joe, while youÂre over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
The RossÂIs that back?!! 
===
Joey, that paperÂs like a year old!
sale is over?!
===
 Hey.
Hey.
===
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnÂt invited and you got "and guest?!"
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on RossÂs behalf. I-I think the rule applies here yÂknow, since she has a chance to get on broad backÂ
===
Okay, all right, IÂll take you. IÂll go call Joan. 
Aww thatÂs nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
===
IÂm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, IÂll regret it.
 Hey!
===
Hey!
 What do you got there?
===
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? UhÂ 
===
Dude! Dude! 
Oh!  Sorry. Uh, IÂve got those plans with Phoebe, why?
===
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
===
ThatÂs what Monica said.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think sheÂs trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
===
 And for you sir?
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkinÂ here?
===
ItÂs uh, itÂs already been roasted.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
===
Actually weÂre out of the lobster ravioli. 
Oh well, that changes everything!  YÂknow what Pheebs?
===
Huh?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
===
 Yeah, IÂm very wise. I know.
YÂknow-yÂknow what I really want?
===
What?
Is to have a long, long talk. YÂknow? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
===
 Any progress?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
===
God Joey, this is taking forever!
WhatÂs the rush? What?
===
W-wÂI justÂitÂs thatÂI haveÂyÂknow I have-I have an appointment. And itÂs very important.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
===
WellÂ ItÂs a date.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnÂt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
===
Come on Joey, donÂt make me feel badly about this.
No, IÂm gonna!! ThatÂs right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goinÂ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, youÂre doing the same thing!
===
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
===
Okay, whatever. YÂknow what? I donÂt have time have time to convince you because heÂs only here for four hours, and IÂm gonna go see him! 
Fine!
===
Yeah!
Fine!
===
Yeah! 
 What are you still doinÂ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
===
 Okay, nowÂs not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No! No! No Pheebs, IÂm not gonna yell at you. I just yÂknow, started thinking about you and David and IÂremember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I justÂ Oh Pheebs, come here.  Are you okay?
===
No IÂm not okay. The only guy IÂve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may neverÂI may never see him again. 
Hey, yÂknow you could always visit him.
===
Oh right, like theyÂre gonna let me have a passport.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
===
WellÂButÂNow, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles yÂknow before he does, then he can come back. 
I can give it a shot.
===
Man, look at all those stars!  Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesnÂt it?
 YÂknow what else makes you wonder?
===
Huh?
Check out the rack on this chick! 
===
 No, IÂm not!
Then why are you wearing MonicaÂs jacket?
===
Oh. 
 Ross!
===
What?
Come here, check this out!
===
What? Is it the comet? 
No! No-no. Look, thereÂs a bug stuck in tar right here. 
===
Joey comeÂI canÂt believeÂI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natureÂs most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
women dude.
===
Show me where?
Right-right up here. 
===
 Joey whereÂs the pipe that was holding the door open?
 I donÂt know!   Yeah, I do.
===
ItÂs called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! 
 Oh no! No! No! 
===
Rachel!! Monica!!
Come on!
===
I canÂt believe this!!
All right well, yÂknowÂI guess we know what we have to do to get down.
===
 Yeah, I guess we donÂt have a choice.  Help us! Please help us! WeÂre stuck up on the roof and we canÂt get down!!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. 
===
Yeah! Oh yeah, youÂll be fine! It-itÂll be uh, just like bungy jumping. YÂknow? But instead of bouncing back up you-you wonÂt.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
===
Well, IÂm gonna lie to you Joey, itÂs a possibility.
 I donÂt know Ross! I-I tell you what, letÂs flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
===
Oh, all right.  Tails!  Can you-can you see what it is?
No.
===
Okay. Well, you be careful.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! IÂm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I canÂt go if I break my leg.
===
Well IÂm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He wonÂt have a father if-if I die!
Well all right so, it looks like weÂre even!
===
 YÂknow, yÂknow IÂm lookinÂ and I donÂt think anyoneÂs home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yÂknow explain later.
Yeah? Really? No oneÂs home?
===
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Yeah!
===
Okay, IÂm going to start climb down you now.
All right! Just hurry up!
===
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so weÂre face to face or-or should I climb down your back so weÂre-weÂre butt to face.
I think face to face.
===
I would say that.
Face to face, yeah!
===
Okay, here I go.
All right. 
===
So what do you want me to do?
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
===
Hi.
Hi.
===
 M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
 Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
===
ItÂs still looks pretty far!
ItÂs not that far! Just drop!
===
Hey.
What are you doing?
===
Well, yÂknow I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
 Why would you want to do that?
===
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
a decent place toÂ
===
does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
No. No. No.
===
No?
No. Rosita does not move.
===
IÂm sorry, Rosita? As inÂ
As in Rosita does not move.
===
Joey, itÂs just a chair! WhatÂs the big deal?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and itÂs at the perfect angle so you donÂt get any glare coming of off Stevie.
===
Stevie the TV?
 Is there a problem?
===
Okay, come onÂJoey, IÂll buy you a new one! All right? WeÂll go down to the store right now and weÂll-weÂll get you a new chair.
 SheÂs not even cold yet!
===
But donÂt you think Rosita wouldÂve wanted you to move on? I mean yÂknow, she did always putÂyour comfort first.
ThatÂs true.
===
 Okay? You ready?
Yeah, IÂ  I donÂt want Stevie to see her like this.
===
You will like it!
No I wonÂt.
===
You donÂt even know!
Because, I know what I like and what I donÂt like! ItÂs not the same thing!
===
Well look, if you donÂt like thisÂ
I donÂt know why you say that so soon.
===
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, yÂknow what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
===
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. YÂknow, start the heeling process?
Well, I guess youÂre right. Maybe, maybe IÂll take her down to the incinerator. ItÂs gonna be so said, and kinda cool.  SheÂs heeled!
===
ThatÂs weird.
No itÂs not weird, itÂs a miracle!
===
ItÂs not a miracle Joey! IÂm sure thereÂs some explanation.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
===
Joey, I really donÂtÂ
 Can you tell me how this happened?
===
Well no.
Miracle!
===
No, yÂknow what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Someone like anÂangel?
===
ThatÂs right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. 
 Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! 
===
 I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Yeah, me too. 
===
Hey, howÂsÂhowÂs the uh, miracle chair?
Fine.
===
Yeah? Wow! YÂknow, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
No. Really?
===
you get radio!
 My chair heels itself.
===
Joey you broke my chair!!
chair?!
===
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
So, there was no miracle?!
===
No Joe, no miracle.
 Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. IÂm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
===
AhhhhÂ.
AhhhÂÂ  Eh?
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you donÂt use the words old or downhill or  they still look pretty damn good. 
They do!
===
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
===
Rach, youÂre in a great place in your life. Come on, youÂve got a great job! Good friendsÂ
Yeah, youÂre roommate is a soap opera star.
===
ThatÂs not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have 
Hey, whatÂs the horsepower on this thing?
===
 Would you put that back on?! MonicaÂs gonna be here any minute!
But it hurtÂs my JoeyÂs Apple.
===
 Is this yours?
Well actuallyÂ
===
No-no-no! ItÂs mine! ItÂs-itÂs mine. 
Dude, you soooo need this car.
===
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Yep. 
===
Okay.
Now that youÂre a couple, we donÂt get two presents from you guys?
===
 Oh thatÂs great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.
 Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
===
 Okay quick, help me get this off! 
Yeah!!
===
I lost a whole year! I canÂt believe it! This is so unfair!
Oh, I donÂt know Pheebs. ItÂll be okay.
===
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
ThatÂs not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!
===
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! IÂI havenÂt done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Like what?
===
Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.
Hey, yÂknow what you guys? I think IÂm gonna go walk her home.  
===
Hey Joey, can IÂ
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
===
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
===
Whatever! Okay, IÂm not your mother.
Okay! 
===
Not in the street!!
Yes!
===
You did the right thing.
 I donÂt like this anymore. 
===
God, do you realize in ten years weÂre gonna be 40?
 Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! 
===
Yes! My babyÂs finally free! 
All-all right!  Start it up! LetÂs go!
===
You wanna buy a car?
No.
===
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. 
 Hey!
===
Hey!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, andÂ
===
ThatÂs great!
And-and-and not only that, IÂm gettinÂ a new brain!!
===
Wait, what do you mean youÂre getting a new brain?
Oh well, theyÂre killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
===
What? A brain transplant?!
 Yes, itÂs a highly controversial procedure.
===
ItÂs ridiculous!
Well, I think itÂs ridiculous that you havenÂt had sex in three and a half months.
===
Who are they killing off?
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
===
SheÂs my favorite character on DOOL.
Nice.
===
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Oh, tell me about it. And sheÂs been on the show forever, itÂs gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
===
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Yes, but in Drake RemorayÂs body.  Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
===
 Can I get some ice here?!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
===
YouÂre not the fan whoÂs dying are you?
Say what?
===
IÂm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but thatÂs not supposed to be until  later!
No. No, IÂm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-IÂm the guy in the coma!
===
Oh that was a real person?!
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since IÂm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give meÂ
===
I-I-IÂm leaving the show?
 I donÂt know. Why? Did you hear something?
===
Who told you that?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
===
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
UmmÂ
===
YÂknow what? It doesnÂt matter! Because it is not true!
Okay.
===
you come to me ask me for tips about a character that IÂve been playing for 20 yearsÂIÂll give you a tip! 
Ms. MonroeÂ  Oh there you go. 
===
 IÂm 16.
See you in 2003. 
===
 YouÂre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They donÂt know exactly when itÂs going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and thatÂs it.
IÂm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
===
Yeah, thanks.
No I mean it! I canÂt believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
===
Oh youÂre right. Thank you! WhatÂs your name again?
Joey.
===
 IÂm having a conversation here!  You were saying?
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yeÂl-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, IÂm really nervous about-about being you. YÂknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. YÂknow? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
===
YouÂre so welcome.
Hey! Now, IÂve been watching some tapes, howÂs this?  "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
===
Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.
===
Yeah but Jessica doesnÂt have an English accent.
 I can do an English accent?! That babyÂs going on my resume!
===
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  You try.
Okay!  All right!
===
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! HeÂs not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Okay. Okay. 
===
I am. I am, but I donÂt know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Hey thatÂs not true! Look at uh, look at Angela LansbÂAngelina Jolie!
===
I probably shouldÂve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but yÂknow I just got so comfy here! AndÂ Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Like-like what?
===
Well, letÂs just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
 Wow!
===
ButÂ Well now, nowÂs a different time for me. 
Oh hey come on, donÂt-donÂt-donÂt do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, IÂm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!"  Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
===
 You think IÂm hot?
You own the room.  We should probably get-get uhÂ
===
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get theÂ  So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the manÂs face. 
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that Âcause sheÂs so passionate?
===
No! ItÂs because that way the camera only sees her!  Do you wanna try it?
Yeah! Okay. 
===
Well, you certainly own that room.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
===
Hi.
Hey!
===
 
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
===
Oh that explains all the womenÂs underwear.
 Sure. Yep.
===
God. You seem really, really nice.
Okay, bye-bye.
===
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
All right, here we go. 
===
youÂre great!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya!   I-I am so sorry. IÂ
===
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. IÂm used to it, donÂt worry about it.
 Oh my God!
===
What?
They sent me todayÂs script! They never send the script!
===
They donÂt?
Well no, IÂm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines!  OhÂ
===
How does it happen?
 Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
===
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Yeah well, IÂm guessing after this sheÂs not going to be crazy about electricity either.
===
I canÂt believe sheÂs really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours. 
 I donÂt think so.
===
 That was so wonderful!  Ohh, I think that youÂre a better Jessica than I ever was!
Oh nooÂ
===
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Thanks!
===
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
===
A film in Guadalajara!
The airport?
===
No thatÂs La Guardia.  This is Mexico.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
===
Eight months.
ThatÂs a really long time.
===
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.  And I just got what you meant againÂThat isÂI tell ya, that is a tricky one!
===
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. YouÂve, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Good luck.
===
Yes! A friend of mine did it and itÂs totally legal!
I call it!!
===
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
===
WeÂre never gonna find anybody.
Well then let me do it!
===
JoeÂ
No-no-no! Look, IÂve been thinking about it. IÂm an actor right? So I wonÂt get nervous talking in front of people.
===
Joey look itÂs really sweetÂ
No-no-no-no look no! I wonÂt spit, and I wonÂt stare at MonicaÂs breasts! YÂknow? Everyone knows IÂm an ass man!
===
That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wonÂt be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. ItÂll be me! And I swear IÂll do a really good job. Plus, yÂknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
===
It might be kinda cool.
So I can do it?
===
Yeah you can do it.
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
===
Yeah.
Okay.
===
Oh.
Oh! My head! Oh!  Oh!
===
In case it happens.
 Hey!
===
Hey!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! 
===
You did it! You got ordained?!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
===
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Anyway, I started working on what IÂm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
===
Yeah!
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft soÂ  "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."  Eh?  "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."  "We too can share and love and have and receive."
===
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! 
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
===
Yeah. O-okay.
 "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving andÂ" And then I canÂt think of a good word for right here. 
===
How about receiving?
Yes!
===
See Joe, not that thatÂs not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! YÂknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
===
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yÂknow, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe IÂll talk about London! YÂknow when you two hooked up! Only, only I wonÂt say hooked up. IÂll say, "Began their beautiful journeyÂ"
===
There you go!
"Âby doinÂ it."
===
Joe?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing yÂknow youÂre in the bathtub together and sheÂs feeding you strawberries?
===
IsnÂt that what happened with you and the brideÂs maid?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
===
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was RossÂs mom.
Oh.
===
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too muchÂ
Yeah baby!
===
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Oh.
===
But then later that nightÂ
Yeah baby!
===
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! 
Hey!
===
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-eÂ 
Oh, dude IÂm so sorry!
===
No! No! No!
Hey no-no-no-no! ItÂs cool! ItÂs cool! I-IÂll only be a second, IÂm still with my brideÂs maid, I justÂWhere are those condoms you brought?
===
TheyÂre in my bag over there. 
Ah. 
===
Uh, could you leave me one?
 For just you?
===
Yeah.
Hey listen, why donÂt you come downstairs with me? ThereÂs some really nice girls down there.
===
No I-I-IÂm fine.
All right, here you go buddy.  Go nuts. 
===
doing nothing for me.
OhÂ  Can you imagine if I hadnÂt left you that last one? You two mightÂve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! ItÂs like it was in the stars!
===
donÂt be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wantedÂjust sex. So, when IÂwent to your room that nightÂI was actually lookingÂfor Joey. 
Yeah baby!  No baby!
===
that was there that night! It is 
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receivÂ
===
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Hey!  Now IÂm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
===
 Look there is no way youÂre doing this wedding now. Okay?
What?! ThatÂs not fair! ItÂs not my fault! I was off with my brideÂs maid! And whoÂs to say I wouldÂve even said yes?!  I mean I wouldÂve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
===
Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
===
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the weddingÂ
No-hey-no! If you donÂt want me to do it, I except that. I donÂt care about that. I justÂI donÂt want you to be upset.
===
fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! YouÂre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, Âcause you guys are perfect for each other. YÂknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it justÂit-it fits. YÂknow? And you just know itÂs gonna last forever.
===
ThatÂs what you should say.
What?
===
When youÂre marrying us; thatÂs what you should say.
Really? I can do it?
===
IÂd love it if you would do it.
Hey! 
===
words!
Well I donÂt know remember exactly but, itÂs-itÂs pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
===
Hey-hey.
So are guys doing okay?
===
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!
===
Yep! And lotÂs of it!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
===
 Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill!  ThatÂs it! IÂm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
===
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Food? Uh-huh gimme! 
===
Staying out of the way.
This is impossible Monica, why donÂt you just pick all 15? 
===
There were only twelve.
Oh yeah, I added three.
===
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Oh yeahÂ 
===
IÂm moving in.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
===
Oh okay. But yÂknow what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Boyfriend?
===
No.
IÂm Joey. 
===
Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?
===
Kristen.
Got it!  SoÂ
===
So uh, do you live around here?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there.  Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
===
IÂll remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
===
Oh I, I have plans tonight. 
Oh.
===
But how about tomorrow?
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go? 
===
You look strong, why donÂt I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, IÂll grab this one. 
===
Yeah in fact, IÂm gonna go call her right now. And IÂll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler saysÂ 
 Hey Chandler!
===
Hey!
Listen, sorry I didnÂt stop by last night but I had a date.
===
Uh Joe, when itÂs one oÂclock in the morning and you donÂt come by? ThatÂs okay!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
===
Really? Right across the street?
Yeah!
===
WhenÂd you meet her?
Two days ago.
===
Excellent! YÂknow Ross met somebody too!
Oh yeah?
===
 Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in RossÂs situation?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, IÂm dating this girl whoÂs also seeing another guy. But, I donÂt know, IÂm not to worried about it.
===
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
===
ThatÂs interesting, but check this out. I date herÂ
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another directionÂ
===
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
===
Maybe IÂll take her to that new French restaurant down the streetÂ
Ah yeahÂwait a second now! Look weÂre gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I donÂt have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
===
Well sorry, thatÂs what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess IÂll just have to do what I do on dates.
===
So letÂs decide on the spending limitÂ
Yeah. Uh, Âa sliceÂÂsix dollars?
===
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
===
Hey! WhatÂs up?
I just wanted to come by and yÂknow, wish you good luck on your date.
===
Oh thanks!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
===
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Wow, thatÂs in like 20 minutes. YouÂd better get dressed.
===
I am dressed.
Oh. Well good!  For me.  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
===
I have an oily T-zone!
Okay dude!  Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
===
ThatÂs right.
You spent a hundred dollars. ThatÂs the limit. YouÂre screwed!
===
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I donÂt know.
===
Why am I not surprised?
YÂknow what Ross? IÂm not gonna let you get away with this!
===
I donÂt think you have much choice.
Well weÂll see!
===
Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
===
Oh yeah itÂs fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
 Kristen?
===
Joey!
Hi!
===
Hi! What are you doing here?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically IÂm not breaking any rules so IÂ
===
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Hi!
===
Yeah. SoÂ
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! 
===
ThatÂs right! ThatÂs right, donÂt you play a woman?
A woman in a manÂs body.
===
Much better.
So yÂknow Ross itÂs funny Âcause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
===
ThatÂs right! Wait no, Ben.
So youÂve just married the one time then?
===
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
 Yeah. So uh Ross, well nowÂwhy did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
===
No. No.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
===
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
===
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
===
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Monkey lover!
===
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes weÂre gonna have younger looking skin!
Yeah!  YÂknow, she could use a littleÂ  Oh nice shot!!! 
===
Congratulations! Wow! I canÂt believe youÂre nominated for an 
No-no.
===
award!
No! IÂm up for a Soapie!
===
Honey? Is that something youÂre making up?
No, no, no! ItÂs real! And it has been since 1998.  Hey Rach! Rach! IÂm up for a Soapie!
===
 Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who IÂm taking to the awards. 
===
Oh, stop that! DonÂt kid about that!  Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.
===
IÂm fourth!  Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you donÂt tell anyone about this.
===
What? No! ItÂs not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Really?
===
Yeah.
What award are you practicing for?
===

Oh, hey listen! The SoapieÂs called today and I also get to present an award.
===
Ohh thatÂs great!
Yeah!
===
So youÂll definitely get onstage, even if you donÂt win.
 What you-you donÂt think IÂm gonna win?
===
Well of course I do! But yÂknow, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean youÂre up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but itÂs justÂIÂve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
===
Well Joey, youÂll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. YÂknow when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. YÂknow? So itÂs sorta likeÂ 
Hey! 
===
YÂknow?
too?
===
I always win.
Ah.
===
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
===
ThereÂs this kid in my class who said heÂs in love with me.
Whoa!
===
 Whoa what?
Ross has a boyfriend.
===
Yeah.
HowÂd you get over that teacher?
===
I didnÂt. I got under him.
 Problem solved.
===
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah, I got my speech!
===
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah. 
===
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
===
On TV?! Yeah!
ÂKay! 
===
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! 
===
Oh my God you stole her award!
No-no! No, IÂm accepting it on her behalf. 
===
Joey I donÂt think you know what behalf means.
Sure I do! ItÂs a verb! As in, "I behalfinÂ it!"
===
 No! Joey!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of Âem.
===
Do you really want an award you didnÂt win?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobodyÂs giving me any of those! PlusÂHey Rach, if-if I put it up there  right? When people come over theyÂll see it and theyÂll think I won it.
===
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I can scratch that right off.
===
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You donÂt want to win an award this way. YouÂre very talented. And someday youÂre gonna win one of these for real and 
All right!
===
All right?  Thank you.
IÂll take it back tomorrow.
===
I cannot believe IÂm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
===
 Hey Jess.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
===
ÂSup? 
Uh listen, hereÂs your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. 
===
 Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?! 
Well, that-that-thatÂs it? YouÂre gonna, youÂre gonna put it on your self or anything?
===
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if youÂll excuse me. 
 Take it back?
===
Absolutely.
Y-y-yeah!  Yeah you do. 
===
 Oh hey! How was your audition?
IÂm sorry, do I know you?
===
What are you doing?
Nothing, IÂm just practicing blowing you off because IÂm gonna be a big movie star!
===
Oh! You got it?!
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
===
What was it for?
Oh, itÂs this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. ItÂs really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
===
The next, next?
Yeah, thereÂs this guy from Chicago whoÂs supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guyÂs right after him.  Hello!
===
Joey! ItÂs Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they 
 They loved me!
===
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
 Oh my God!
===
ThereÂs just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!  Oh.  Uh, okay uh let me call you back. 
===
WhatÂs the matter?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
===
Wow!
I know! My grandmotherÂs gonna see this!
===
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I donÂt know! ItÂs not like itÂs porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. YÂknow? And the nudity is really important to the story.
===
ThatÂs what you say about porn.
YouÂre right. Maybe I shouldnÂt even go on the call back.
===
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Well thatÂs true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My characterÂs catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. ItÂs really sweet and-and tender.
===
Hi-hi Joey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
===
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didnÂt need to come down here today.
Oh great! YÂknow I wouldÂve been perfect for this part, but whatever! YÂknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! 
===
Wait Joey! You didnÂt need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? WasnÂt that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
===
Well, the director thinks youÂre really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! ThatÂs great!
===
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as itÂs handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
===
Terrific! Well uh, thereÂs one more thing. Uhh, uh itÂs really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how sheÂs never seen a naked man who wasnÂt Jewish. SoÂ 
SoÂWhat?
===
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what IÂm saying?
Yes!
===
Okay.
No. What?
===
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not beÂ
Barmifsaed?
===
So to get this part you canÂt be?
Nope.
===
But you are?
Yep.
===
But you told them you werenÂt?
ThatÂs right.
===
Wow! Wow! And itÂs definitely all gone? ThereÂs nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?
I donÂt know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell Âem you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
===
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning toÂgrow a turtleneck!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
===
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I canÂt do the part. 
===
Unless!
Unless what?
===
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Like what?
===
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Wow! This looks great!
===
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna. 
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
===
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Thank God!
===
 Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. 
Ah.
===
Okay?  Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know itÂs gonna shrink.
Well maybe we just take that one away. 
===
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, thatÂs really just for me.  Okay. So, why donÂt you go into your room and try these on and weÂll seeÂget a better idea of whatÂs gonna work.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
===
Toothpick?
Yeah.
===
What are you trying on now?
The fruit roll up.
===
And?
Delicious.
===
Joey!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
===
Yeah.
My whole familyÂs from Naples!
===
Joey, this is awkward part.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem.  I totally understand. You need to yÂknow make sure I donÂt have any horrible scars or tattoos. DonÂt you worry; I have nothing to hide.  So there you go, thatÂs me.  One hundred percent natural!   I tell ya, that has never happened before.
===
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
===
Okay! 
Hey guys! Look whoÂs back! ItÂs Ray-ray!
===
Wait a minute, she isnÂtÂ SheÂs not the one who youÂ
 Who you what? Who you what?!
===
Wow!
 Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who youÂwhat?!!
===
What?!
What?!
===
Chandler, relax itÂs not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.
 Hello!
===
Hey!
Hey Rach.  
===
Okay, I think thatÂs it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like theyÂre having fun donÂt they?
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
===
Oh!  LetÂs see, wellÂif this is the wedding hall then umm  youÂre parents will be at home in Queens.
What theyÂre not invited?! Oh no, thatÂs terrible! TheyÂre gonna be crushed!
===
Why would they think theyÂre invited?
 You got me. I donÂtÂ
===
Joey!
Well, IÂm sorry. I thought parents were coming! YÂknow? Your parents are cominÂ! ChandlerÂs parents are cominÂ! RossÂs parents are cominÂ!
===
parents!
Well-wellÂsee? Parents are cominÂ!
===
That is not a problem.
 Maybe youÂll order a little sangria?
===
I like our way. Oh!  Chess!
Nice move.
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
No, IÂm performing the ceremony. IÂm not wearing a tux.
===
Well, what are you going to wear?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
===
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
I donÂt think so.
===
Oh, yÂknow what? I canÂt. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
 Can I come?! I wonÂt even talk! YouÂll just hear the noise from my video camera.
===
What is this? WhatÂs going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
===
JoeyÂs!
OkayÂ
===
Sure!
Hey.  It happened!
===
 Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me?
===
Okay! All right! Yeah! ÂCause I just canÂt picture it.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
===
Hey. Oh good-good youÂre here! All right, I figured it out. IÂm gonna take two tables of eight, IÂm gonna add your parents, and IÂm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Yeah, theyÂre not coming.
===
 What?!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. TheyÂfeel a little unwanted.
===
Oh thatÂs too bad. ItÂs true, but too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my momÂ
===
Oh Joey!
Come on! Look just-just tellÂlet her know that you really want them to be there. LetÂs not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
===
No she hasnÂt.
Is it her fault that some of them didnÂt make it to you?
===
Ooh, yum! 
 Hey.
===
Hey.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
===
The show?!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, itÂs gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
===
weddings?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is itÂs the same day as my nieceÂs christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ÂCause my partÂs just in the beginning IÂm not even in the rest of the showÂWedding!
===
The wedding starts at six.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little Âtil they get there?
===
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. 
 Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
===
All right thatÂs it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I donÂt care!
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. TheyÂre so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
===
Well, youÂre welcome. And tell them weÂre really glad theyÂre coming.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!  Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this  is for party time.
===
 Monica, there are no wordsÂ  There are no words! This should not be this hard!
All right, uhÂ  Oh hey, youÂve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
===
 MonicaÂ
"Âwhen I look back over our time togetherÂ"
===
 Yeah?
Well, I canÂt do everything! Look back over your time together.
===
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
===
I canÂt believe theyÂve been together for three years.
 Has it been that long?!
===
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
===
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
===
I donÂt know why they didnÂt just tell us.
I know! I mean itÂs not like we werenÂt cool about it.
===
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!
===
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
===
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
===
Phoebe knows about us!
didn't tell them!
===
Them?! Who's them?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
===
Joey!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
===
I can not believe he would do that to MonÂWhoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?
No.
===
Joey!
They know you know.
===
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
===
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
 Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
===
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh!
===
Okay!
I like that!  Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! 
===
Joey!  Wow, you didnÂt rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
===
Well, things change.
dealership!
===
ItÂll be okay Joe.
IÂm sorry, I justÂI like things the way they are.
===
Looks like a fun gang. 
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
Oh!
Hey!
===
 Oh, thatÂs beautiful.
  Funny one! ThatÂs good!
===
 Dude!
 I have never known love like this.
===
that!
If he goes first he can!
===
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after youÂre done.
 Hey!
===
Hey!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookinÂ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
===
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche IÂll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
===
Hey guys!
Hey!
===
What?  Oh.  Ooh.  Whoa! That one kept going. 
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
===
Over a month.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
===
Sure, IÂd like that.
So uh, whatÂs your name?
===
 Its Jake.
Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
===
Yeah, big fan.
Me too! ThereÂs a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
===
Hey!
Listen, you know how uh, when youÂre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
===
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw thatÂhe was wearing womenÂs underwear!
===
I know. They were mine.
Oh.  No! No wait, thatÂs weird!
===
No, itÂs not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
ThatÂs weird!
===
IÂm wearing his briefs right now.
ThatÂsÂkinda hot.
===
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldnÂt know about that.
===
And! YÂknow what Jake says? That womenÂs underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, heÂll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
===
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! IÂm thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
===
IÂm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womenÂs underwear! I donÂt think you could ever do that.
secure with my masculinity.
===
Okay whatever.
YouÂve seen my huge stack of porn right? 
===
Hey!
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!
===
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
YÂknow, IÂm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
===
Uh-huh.
The silk? Feels really good!
===
Huh.
Yeah! And-and things arenÂt asÂsmashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
===
Hmm?
Pantyhose! YÂknow? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to hereÂ  I should go take these off shouldnÂt I?
===
Feel better?
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that IÂm yÂknow insecure about my manhood or anything yÂknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
===
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
===
Hi!
YÂknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
===
Wow!
Yeah.
===
Really?!
Hm-mmm.
===
 $4.50 please.
Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.
===
Ah. Joey youÂre-youÂre having lunch with my mom?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! 
===
I had to go with the odds Rach.
 Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didnÂt get the part?
===
The commercial?
No!
===
That play?
No!
===
That other play?
Nooo!
===
The movie?
Yes!!
===
Ohh!
Yes thatÂs the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
===
Oh, yeah! Back then yÂknow, we called the Great War. It really was!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
===
Wait! Wait! Wait! You canÂt start today! TodayÂs the rehearsal dinner!
Oh no, IÂll be done by then.
===
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
I know! All right, IÂll see you guys over there! IÂm off to fight the Nazis.
===
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? 
===
 Hey Joey! WeÂre ready.
Yeah! Me too. 
===
 Richard? WeÂre ready for you.  Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby heÂs playing Vincent.
IÂm doing my scenes with you?
===
Nice to meet you Joey.
Wow! I canÂt believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
===
No I didnÂt.
I think you did.
===
I think I lost. Three times.
UhÂCookie?
===
Okay, all right. LetÂs do it.  AndÂAction!
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
===
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone! 
 What?!
===
 The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
 So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
===
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
 No. Nope, I uhÂI thÂI thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. YÂknow? HeÂs uh, heÂs a face toucher. 
===
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Oh.
===
What? Are you going back to work?
Yeah.
===
Nice shades.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I wonÂt get spit in the eyes, yÂknow?
===
was the official sponsor of World War I!
Great! All right. IÂll see you later. 
===
Hey, whereÂs Chandler?
Uh, I think heÂs in RachelÂs room. See ya. 
===
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me? 
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
===
Just the last two pages.
All right.
===
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Okay uh, look I know youÂre a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuffÂ
===
Oh, thanks.
But youÂre spittinÂ all over me man!
===
Well of course I am!
youÂve been spitting on me?!
===
ThatÂs what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!  
 Wow! DidnÂt know that.
===
Great!
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out!  Picture? What picture?  Eh?
===
I found the picture!
What picture?!
===
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
You went through my personal property?
===
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
 Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!
===
Oh youÂre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Thanks a lot.
===
 HereÂs your call sheet for tomorrow.
Oh, IÂm-IÂm not working tomorrow.
===
You are now.
No! No! I canÂt! You gotta get me out of it! IÂve got plans!  Important plans! 
===
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We canÂt stop filming just for you. ItÂs not like itÂs your wedding. 
IÂm having surgery!
===
What?!
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didnÂt want you to worry about me. But, IÂm having surgery today.
===
What kind of surgery?!
Transplant.
===
But youÂre supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transplant.
===
But youÂre not bald.
ItÂs not on my head.
===
Look Joey, thereÂs nothing I can do. Besides, youÂre probably gonna be out by four anyway. WeÂve just got one short scene. ItÂs just you and Richard, and God knows heÂs a pro. YouÂll be fine.  Morning Richard.
Hey! YouÂre here! Great! Great! Great! LetÂs get going buddy, weÂve got a scene to shoot!
===
IÂm wearing two belts.
Are you drunk?
===
No!
Yes you are!
===
LetÂs reset.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
===
 Are you a little off today? ItÂs going terribly slowly.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And IÂm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
===
Of course! IÂm-IÂm sorry. I-IÂd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.
===
Still rolling, annnnd action!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
===
Hello?
 Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
===
Yeah, we got him back. EverythingÂs fine.
Damnit!
===
What? Why? Where are you?
IÂm still on the set!
===
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! IÂm sorry! The guyÂs drunk, they wonÂt let me go until we get this.
===
Oh my God! IÂm gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, IÂm the minister! All right, look-look, put Âem both on the phone, IÂll marry them right now.
===
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! DonÂt you hang up on me! IÂll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
===
You wouldnÂt happen to have a very big fork?
So I uh, I just talked to the director. ThatÂs it, weÂre done for the day.
===
Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! YouÂyou were wonderful.
===
As were you.
So I got your car, itÂs right outside.
===
Why? Are we done for the day?
ThatÂs what you told me.
===
Oh, thank you. YouÂre welcome. 
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.
===
Chandler, for so long IÂI wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that IÂd ever been looking for my whole life. And nowÂhere we areÂwith our future before usÂand I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you donÂt want to. You go!
Chandler?
===
 No, thatÂs okay.  Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way itÂs okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if IÂm sure? 
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
===
I do.
Yeah you do!
===
Rings?
Aw crap! OkayÂuhÂuh letÂs-letÂs do the rings. 
===
What are you doing?!
YouÂre still a tiny bit on fire there.
===
I think, subconsciouslyÂ
 Nope, you lost me.
===
What do I smell?
 Sorry. 
===
What do I smell?
I donÂt know, but it smells good. 
===
Nothing.
NothinÂ.
===
 Whoa! SheÂs purty!
Oh yeah, and sheÂs really nice too! She taught me about yÂknow, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
===
Oh what are doing?!
YouÂre still a tiny bit on fire there!
===
 Okay, I know IÂm not supposed to know, but I do. And IÂm so excited for you!
What? WhatÂs going on?
===
MonicaÂs pregnant!
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
===
Guys! IÂm not pregnant.
Ah.  Slow swimmers? 
===
 Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
I canÂt! I-I donÂt have any other clothes here.
===
 Oh sweet Lord.
IÂm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and itÂs either this or a bathrobe! Look, whatÂs more important, the way IÂm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
===
Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
I donÂt believe weÂve met, Joey Tribbiani.
===
Dennis Phillips
Wow, IÂve admired your work for years. You-youÂve done some really amazing stuff.
===
Oh, thank you. Well if youÂll excuse me, IÂm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. 
Wow Dennis Phillips! ThatÂs great! How did you guys meet?
===
What size shoes do you wear?
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
===
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Uh, I donÂt even really know where I left those. Sorry.
===
 Those arenÂt eleven and a half.
Okay fine! IÂm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, IÂll show ya!
===
And the world will never know.
Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
===
just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Hey!
===
Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
Well, IÂd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know youÂre casting for this new showÂ
===
Look umm Joey, I-I donÂt think youÂre quite right for this project.
Oh, see thatÂs where youÂre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didnÂt see it up there, just-just try me.
===
ItÂs an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
Well IÂm not proud of this, butÂ 
===
I just didnÂt see the fast song coming.
Shh. Shh. DonÂt try to talk, weÂll get you up to your room, weÂll soak your feet, youÂll be okay.
===
That is so sweet!
Yeah.
===
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
Tell me about it, I feel like IÂm holding down the fort all by myself.
===
ItÂs Joey right?
Yeah.
===
Listen yÂknow what sir? For the last time, I donÂt care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
 Hey!
===
Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
No.  I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
===
What? What did you take a picture of?
Nothing! It was something.
===
Oh thanks.  Champagne, strawberriesÂOh my God! I canÂt believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Yeah, thatÂs sad. Mashuga nut?
===
I donÂt. He gotÂhe-he-he-heÂs hit by a bus.
 Hey!
===
Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
 Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call!  I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
===
Oh Joey! Joey! No, itÂs not you! You didnÂt get anybody pregnant!
Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on?  Is somebody pregnant?
===
Oh yeah. ThatÂs me.
Oh my God Pheebs! YouÂre gonna have a baby?
===
Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, IÂm gonna have a baby! 
Whoa, wait a minute. WhoÂs the father?
===
You donÂt know him. ItÂs not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. 
Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ÂCause I will track him down and kick his ass!
===
David Lynn.
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! 
===
No! No! I shouldnÂt have even opened these! I mean IÂJoey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Okay.
===
Give me one more.
Okay. 
===
 Hey.
Oh good, uh youÂre here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say. 
===
All right. 
Umm, now uhÂ ItÂs a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. YÂknow, now I always thought you and I had a special bond soÂ  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
===
Phoebe!
Why?! Why canÂt she marry me?!
===
SheÂs not pregnant. ItÂs Rachel. RachelÂs the one whoÂs pregnant.
Oh my God.
===
ItÂs Joey! 
 Now I canÂt believe it! What? RachelÂs pregnant?  WhoÂs the father?
===
We donÂt know.
OhhÂ I wonder if that dude.
===
ThereÂs a dude?
Yeah.
===
Who? Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnÂt see who it was butÂ 
===
 I donÂt know how any of these got opened?!
 You opened them all?
===
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
Oh hey! You got my parentÂs gift! 
===
Yeah. What is that?
Well, I donÂt know. I think it does something to salami.
===
Hey! HowÂd it go?
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
===
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. 
===
No, I will. IÂm just not up for it tonight.
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youÂre not gonna be alone in this.
===
IÂm not?
Listen I uhÂ  ItÂs a scary world out there especially if youÂre a single mom. YÂknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. YÂknow? So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
===
What?!!
Pheebs, give me the ring back!
===
No! Joey, oh youÂre so sweet. YouÂre so-so sweet, honey. But IÂm not, IÂm not looking for a husband.
 I understand.
===
I canÂt say that didnÂt hurt. But IÂll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offeredÂ
===
Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
There you go!
===
Oh my God!!
 Oh my God!
===
ThatÂs right. Get it out of your system while weÂre alone.
 Hey!
===
Me too! 
IÂm gonna be an uncle! Come here! 
===
Well I was gonna tell him that IÂm-IÂm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
Well that, that sounds good.
===
Yeah, bye.
Bye.
===
 What?!  I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
What secrets?
===
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
YÂknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
===
All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
I donÂt have a key, they took mine to give to you.
===
What?! They took mine to give to you!
Why would they take away our keys?
===
Maybe they donÂt trust us.
No thatÂs not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town. 
===
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with MonicaÂs guest towels?
Hey, I washed those!
===
No you didnÂt.
Yeah that didnÂt sound like me.
===
Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
===
What stuff?
MonicaÂs chicken parm! IÂll take care of it.  Hey Mr. Treeger, itÂs Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and ChandlerÂs apartment. ItÂs an emergency.  Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. 
===
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
===
Well, we-we said weÂd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Yeah, I donÂt think thatÂs what it is.
===
Why? What-what else could it be?
Oh wow, I donÂt feel well.
===
 Maybe itÂs something you ate?
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
===
IÂve looked everywhere. ThereÂs no gas leak.
 Huh. So then I can heat this up? 
===
Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
So itÂs noticeable huh?
===
Yeah but uhÂ Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but thereÂs something else.  RachelÂs pregnant.
 Oh my God!!! I canÂt believe that!!
===
A little bit.
How are you doing?
===
Okay. Okay. I mean IÂll be okay. ItÂs just I donÂt think I handled it very well.
Well, what did you say to her?
===
But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
 What?
===
I gotta go find her.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they donÂt even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
===
Evidently they do.
What?! 
===
What else is new?
Yeah and weÂd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
===
Well do something! Get in there!
How? I guess I could break down your door.
===
Yeah! Do that!
And-and you wonÂt blame us for any damage? 
===
No!  Are you doing it?! I donÂt hear anything! Come on!
Uh, okay IÂll-IÂll-IÂll break it down. 
===
Hi.
Hey!
===
Oh.
I donÂt see the baby. Where is it?
===
Hi!
Hey! YouÂre back! 
===
I know.
A couple? Like two people? Like  one , two people?
===
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chanceÂ
YÂknow what? Why donÂt you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
===
We didnÂt get anything for anyone.
Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
===
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there Âcause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
YouÂre welcome buddy.
===
Yes letÂs. YÂknow what? Uh, itÂs-itÂs not important. What is important is that, is that weÂre having a baby. And itÂs notÂDoesnÂt matter who came on to who.
Whom.  ThatÂs right.
===
he taped the two of them having sex!
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
===
LetÂs call Âem.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
===
 Hello?  Eighth street deli?
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkinÂ to that place.
===
 Hello?   ItÂs the deli again!
All right! IÂll have a sandwich!
===
What?! People donÂt do that!
Oh I think we do.
===
And youÂve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
YÂknow what? DonÂt worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
===
Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, hereÂs what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. 
Personal thing? What personal thing? I donÂt know.
===
AboutÂabout sex?  That I hadnÂt had sex in months?
 Yeah I knew what you were talkinÂ about.
===
Hey!
Hey.
===
Do you have a minute? IÂd like to talk to you about something IÂm, IÂm really uncomfortable talking about.
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
===
I actually had a topic in mind! IÂm, IÂm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Whoa, for like months?
===
Five to be lying, six.
Six months? Whoa thatÂs rough.
===
Well, I mean itÂs not all bad. IÂm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
The skyÂs blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
===
Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okayÂIÂm scared for my health!
Okay. Okay. UmmÂOoh! Oh-oh, I got something. ItÂs this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; theyÂre like putty.
===
 IÂll try to control myself.
Okay.  Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western EuropeÂ
===
 You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Have a nice six more months Ross! 
===
 Okay! Okay! Okay. IÂm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  It was dead silent. Gorgeous.  And across the lake I sawÂa beautiful womanÂbathing herselfÂbut she was cryingÂ
===
Great! IÂm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Hey! Look, if it didnÂt work itÂs because you didnÂt tell it right! Show me how you did it.
===
No! No, I donÂtÂdonÂt want to.
How long since youÂve seen a girl naked?
===
I was backpacking across Western Europe.
IÂm not feeling it.
===
I was just outside Barcelona, hikingÂ
No! No! No Ross! IÂm not hot! Are you hot?
===
ItÂs been six months! IÂm always hot!
Well youÂre not selling the story! ItÂs like; itÂs like you donÂt believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when IÂm preparing for an audition. Okay? IÂll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what youÂre doing wrong.
===
IÂll try that.
All right nowÂ All right, youÂre all set up. YouÂre good to go. Just hit record. All right?
===
Thanks.
Good luck.
===
Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Yeah?
===
Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know IÂll help you out.
 That means a lot to me man. 
===
What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
YÂknow what? This is not fair to her. LetÂs just forget the tape!
===
Thank you.  No!
YouÂre right. 
===
Joey! No!
Loud and clear! 
===
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
YÂknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnÂt give you real names either.
===
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they donÂt give out fake names.
Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
===
 Hey! Is Ross still here?
Uh no Rach, heÂs gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
===
Clearly you donÂt want people to see this tape. Now I donÂt want people to see this tape either, but you so badly donÂt people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
 Are we watchinÂ the tape or not?!
===
 Hello! Can I get you anything?
 IÂm so happy!
===
How do you know about that story?!
know about that story?!
===
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
 Some guy!! 
===
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
 Ken Adams!!
===
What is it?
Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting JessicaÂs brain.
===
Is it serious?
Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.
===
Well that sounds simple enough, letÂs just do that.
We would, but when we went to exhume JessicaÂs body, it was gone.
===
Cut! Very nice people!
 Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
===
Well donÂtÂWhat happened to JessicaÂs body?!
IÂm not telling, youÂll have to see it on TV!
===
You donÂt know do you?
No, couldnÂt care less.
===
Hey good scene man.
Hey you too!
===
Oh! 
Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
===
Yes?
This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
===
Well, Joey probably thinks IÂll just embarrass him. YÂknow, he thinks IÂm some kind of a soap opera nutÂWhich IÂm not! IÂm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.  And uh, and that your-your dogÂs name is Wally. Well look at that, IÂm just stroking your arm.
 Here we go! Here we go! 
===
Hi!
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
===
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, IÂm with you. He even asked me if I thought youÂd go out with him.
===
Oh! Oh, I think IÂm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.
===
What?!
What? IÂI just figured since youÂre pregnant youÂre not gonna be seeing people.
===
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I didnÂt tell him. I didnÂt know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
===
Good-good, donÂt tell him. DonÂt tell him. Just have him call me okay?
Rach look, I really donÂt think thatÂs such a greatÂ
===
Hi!
Hey!
===
So, what do you want to do tonight? ThereÂs a Ukrainian film at the Angelica thatÂs supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
No. No. But IÂll go see a normal person movie with ya.
===
Why no, itÂs the opposite of weird. ItÂs-itÂs uh, regular. ItÂs-itÂs uh, itÂs mundane. ItÂs actually uh, a little dull.
ItÂs no Ukrainian film.
===
A date?! SheÂs-sheÂs got a date?! With who?
I set her up with this actor on my show.
===
You set her up?!
No
===
Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Well, I was thinking that itÂd probably be okay because Ross hasnÂt gone out with Rachel in five years!
===
Joey, IÂm not worried about her! IÂm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
Hey! IÂm an  actor too! IÂm not sure. I think theyÂre taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
===
A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
===
Hey Joey.
Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
===
Well, I tell you what. Why donÂt we uh, why donÂt we just stay here? LetÂs not see a movie, weÂll just hang.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
===
Hey, if thatÂs what you want to do IÂm not gonna say no.
Dude! What is going on?!
===
I justÂI have to find out how it went.
Why?
===
This guy could be my babyÂs stepfather!
They go on one date and youÂre worried about them getting married?! HeÂs not you!
===
I justÂI-I canÂt believe sheÂs-sheÂs dating?!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
===
I donÂt know! I guess I just canÂt believe any of this is happening.
What do you mean?
===
kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and SusanÂs, itÂs likeÂIt breaks my heart a little. I mean IÂve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. YÂknow? Maybe fight over the science section.
ThatÂs a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
===
No! No I canÂt. I mean RachelÂs out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
===
It used to be. Now she doesnÂt really have a face. SmokinÂ body though.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isnÂt Rachel.
===
No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
I know, but I donÂt think thatÂs what she wants.
===
Yeah.
Hey, I tell you what. LetÂs you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
===
 We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
No, I said fun!
===
 Not two years in a row.
Look, IÂll come to the party but IÂm not dressing up.
===
You have to!
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone youÂre notÂ
===
Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
That hot girl from their wedding?
===
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
 Hey!
===
You didnÂt dress up either?!
Yes I did! IÂm Chandler.  Dude, what happened?
===
How is that me?
Okay. IÂm Chandler 
===
When have I ever done that?!
When have I ever done that?! 
===
Wow! I donÂt have the worst costume anymore!
 Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
===
Hey Joey?
Yeah.
===
You read comic books right?
Exclusively.
===
Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Catwoman, hands down.
===
YeahÂ
But between you and Phoebe, IÂd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
===
What?! Really?!
Are you kiddinÂ? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, sheÂs got this crazy temper. SheÂSheÂs not standing right behind me is she?
===
No youÂre fine.  All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
IÂm not sure.
===
What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here!  As hard as you can!
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesnÂt matter.
===
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, yÂknow, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
I would say, "Woman, please!"
===
No IÂm not! You are!
 Here comes the temper.
===
I canÂt answer that! ChandlerÂs my husband.
So Ross?
===
Oh relax man, relax. YouÂre looking a little flushed.
 Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
===
What question?
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
===
ThereÂs no question.
So you think Ross too?
===
Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop!  Now listen, no oneÂs gonna fight in this apartment.
Hey Monica!  People came to see a fight, letÂs give Âem what they came for!
===
Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
===
Oh yeah? YouÂre going further down! Downtown!
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
===
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Rach?
===
nice meeting you tonight!!
 Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! WeÂre waiting!   Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all.  Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
===
And dignity.
 Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
===
 Wow! TheyÂre both really strong.
Or equally weak.
===
 Yay! My hero!
 YouÂre a weird lady.
===
Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
ThatÂs not so bad.
===
No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just 
Come on! YouÂre good with kids. TheyÂre just crazy on Halloween. YÂknow, theyÂre all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
===
Really? You think thatÂs all it is? 
Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for ChristmasÂand their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime theyÂre hungry or sleepy. YÂknow, kids are tough. Good luck with that. 
===
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? 
 Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
===
Really?!
 No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
===
Sweet!
All right, well finish your coffee; letÂs go.
===
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Oh, youÂre switching apartments?
===
ItÂs not for me, itÂs for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment.
===
Yeah, but when the baby comes sheÂs gonna want to move.
She is?
===
Yeah, you didnÂt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
I guess I didnÂt really think about it.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
How was the game?
Oh, okay. IÂI ate way too much.
===
Oh.
Ooh.  So umm, I was talkinÂ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
===
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
I was kinda hoping youÂd stay.
===
Oh but Joey, I have to go. ThereÂs no room for a baby here.
No room? ItÂs a baby. ItÂs like this big.  YÂknow, I mean you-you could you could put it over here.  Or-or-or we could put it right here.  Aw, itÂs cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here.  You wouldnÂt even notice it. WhereÂs the baby? 
===
Honey, itÂs not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when thereÂs a screaming baby around.
I could use a challenge! ItÂs getting pretty easy.
===
Honey, itÂs so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I canÂt do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didnÂt have to change.
===
I know.
YÂknow I blame Ross for this.
===
I do too a little bit.
IÂm gonna miss you, youÂre the hottest roommate I ever had.
===
What is this?
Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here,  so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uhÂOh look! HereÂs a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
===
YouÂre so sweet.  Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! 
AhhhhhhhhhhhhÂ. That-that-thatÂs really just to show where the baby would go. YÂknow why donÂt I hold on to him so that thereÂs no confusion? 
===
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, itÂs going to be loud.
IÂm loud!
===
ItÂs gonna be up all night!
IÂm up all night!
===
ItÂs gonna poop!
Hello!
===
What about all the women you want to bring home?
Look, if IÂm bringing home a woman who canÂt stand being around a baby, then maybe I donÂt want to be with that woman! Or maybe weÂll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
===
Joey, are you sure?
Yeah! All rightÂLook, I know sometimes itÂll be hard, okay? But, itÂll also be reallyÂreally great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
===
I want me to stay too.
Ohh!
===
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! ItÂs so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
===
Are you seriousÂReally?! ItÂs in such good condition.
Yeah.
===
Wow! Whoa-whoa whatÂs under the covers?
I donÂt know.
===
ItÂs moving.
Ew.
===
ItÂs stillÂÂItÂs got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Ooh! Ah! Okay! 
===
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think IÂm gonna stay here.
IsnÂt that great?
===
I thought we werenÂt gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! YÂknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
ItÂs a grand tradition!
===
Well you couldÂve untied it with your hands.
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnÂt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
===
You went home with the waitress.
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
===
My God! You must be good in bed!
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. HowÂs it going?
===
Ah, itÂs good. ItÂs going good. I mean, we get along great. SheÂs, sheÂs soÂ
Hot?
===
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youÂre going down the same path, but youÂre really going down different ones.
IÂm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
===
Honey! ThatÂs crazy! I donÂt want you to get me a stripperÂ
Will you let the lady talk?!
===
All right fine! But IÂm only doing this for you!
Yeah!
===
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
 IÂm sorry I gotta cancel tonight babyÂ
===
What are you doing?
Look, look letÂs pretend itÂs a real bachelor party. Okay? YÂknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itÂll be fun.
===
Okay. I canÂt believe tomorrowÂs the big day.
How does it feel knowing youÂre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youÂre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
===
So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
Uh, that-thatÂs-thatÂs me!
===
ThatÂs me.
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
===
That was weird.
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
===
So sheÂs aÂ
Yeah, thatÂs one naked hooker!
===
I canÂt believe there is a naked hooker in there!
a stripper, but she got confused about what sheÂs supposed to do.
===
Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but thatÂs gonna cost extra. Okay, hereÂs the extras, handcuffs, spankingÂ 
Maybe MonicaÂs playing a joke on ya. YÂknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thatÂs pretty funny.
===
That is funny, maybe for my birthday sheÂll murder someone.
I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
===
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I justÂ  Why donÂt we just let the machine get that?
 Hey Ross. ItÂs Joey. ThereÂs a hooker over here and we thought maybe youÂd know something about it.
===
Why would she do that?
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youÂre really bad at yÂknow, sexually?
===
WhatÂs taking you boys so long?
In a minute!
===
 In a minute? WhatÂs gonna happen in a minute?!
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
===
Why me?!
Hey! ItÂs your bachelor party.
===
should do it.
I donÂt want to. You do it!
===
You do it!
You do it!
===
All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?
I miss this.
===
I donÂt think weÂve actually done this before!
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
===
Well weÂwe still hang out.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. YÂknow now itÂs likeÂthings are different.
===
Well yÂknow, things are different. IÂmÂIÂm married now.
Oh sureÂAnd hey, donÂt get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I justÂI missÂhanging outÂjust-just us, yÂknow?
===
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on weÂll make time to hang out with each other.
You got it. Come here. 
===
 ÂthereÂs gonna be a wedding!  ThatÂs unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love!  Âconstantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision. 
 Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  What gives you the right toÂ  Go to hell!  Stupid guy on my phone.
===
 Oh myÂGod! Let me see that! 
 You fall for it every time!
===
All right okay, just so you know, IÂm not gonna make a turkey this year.
What?!
===
Well Phoebe doesnÂt eat turkeyÂ
Phoebe!
===
TurkeyÂs are beautiful, intelligent animals!
No theyÂre not! TheyÂre ugly and stupid and delicious!
===
All right! Okay, itÂs just Phoebe. WillÂs still on a diet, Chandler doesnÂt eat Thanksgiving food, and RachelÂs having her aversion to poultry.
She is?
===
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
===
Anyway, it just doesnÂt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? ItÂs a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
===
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justÂthereÂs gonna be a ton left over.
No there wonÂt! I promise I will finish that turkey!
===
All right, youÂre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
ThatÂs right! ÂCause IÂm a Tribbiani!  And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we donÂt read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
===
Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, youÂve got almost an entire turkey to eat.
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. EatinÂ chips is like stretching.
===
All right.
DonÂt worry, Tribbianis never get full.
===
I actually know what youÂre talking about. IÂm here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
 Who the hell is this guy?
===
Will! From high school.
Oh hey!
===
 This is ChandlerÂs chicken. This is the turkey. 
 Oh. How-how big is that?
===
About nineteen pounds.
 ItÂs like me when I was born.
===
I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land. 
 Seriously, who is this guy?
===
Joey stop staring! ThereÂs nothing there! ItÂs not true!
IÂm afraid IÂm gonna need proof.
===
Okay.  ItÂs exactly how IÂd imagined it would be.
 All right whereÂs that turkey!
===
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
===
Is there anything we can do for you?
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
===
Yeah, you want some?
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.  A little bigger.  Little bigger.  What?! Are you afraid youÂre gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
===
Bye. 
Oh hey Rach, listenÂHi!
===
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisorsÂ
Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
===
Really?! Oh my God! IÂm successful!
Okay, so will you meet with her?
===
Yes! IÂd love to! Have her come by the office.
Great! Thanks! YouÂre gonna love her so much. AndÂOh, sheÂs the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, yÂknow the S.A.TÂs?
===
Yeah.
She took Âem!
===
Oh Joey, IÂm hardly aÂ
My little sister Dina!
===
Thanks so much for meetinÂ with me. JoeyÂs told me so much about you!
This is so exciting for her. Well, IÂll let you two fashÂists get down to business. 
===
Honey, why donÂt you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
 Oh. WhatÂs, whatÂs going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dadÂs heart? Is that a sandwich?
===
Joe, mom and dad are fineÂ
Is that a sandwich?!
===
IÂm pregnant.
 What?!
===
 Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! 
Well obviously this is a mistake! You canÂt be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
===
What?! DinaÂ
 Bub!!!   I canÂt believe this! YouÂre the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
===
Why? Where are you going?
I canÂt look at you right now! 
===
Joey, what are you doing?
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this womanÂ
===
Oh Joey this is crazy!
DonÂt interrupt me when IÂm talkinÂ to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this manÂ
===
No!
Oh youÂll take Âem!
===
No I wonÂt!
Hey! You donÂt get a say in this!
===
Yes I do!
Ahhh! I heard "I do", weÂre halfway there! Okay!  You!
===
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Well what am I supposed to do?
===
YouÂre supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
No they canÂt! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
===
Joey, just because theyÂre not getting married doesnÂt mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! LetÂs hear their plan! Now, whatÂs the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
===
WellÂI really have high hopes for my band.
 You were right. He is funny.
===
 Really? 
Dina, if youÂre having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, thatÂs not a compliment!
===
No Joey! I knew you wouldnÂt be supportive!
So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? YouÂre gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourselfÂwithout a husband?! You canÂt be a single mother alone! YouÂre gonna ruin your life!
===
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
No! No! No! ItÂs different for you. YouÂre so strong and together. YouÂre not some dumb kid who doesnÂt know what sheÂs doing.
===
Excuse me?
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
===
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Maybe!  Well! WellÂso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsÂOh forget it! I canÂt!
===
Look, RachelÂs told me how much easier youÂve made all this on her. Why canÂt you do that for me?
Because! ÂCauseÂ ÂCause youÂre my baby sister!
===
And youÂre my big brother! I mean, youÂre my favorite guy in the whole world. IÂm not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
Well IÂd be scared of them, but all right.
===
Joey, I canÂt stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Of course heÂs gonna have his Uncle Joey!
===
WeÂre gonna be all right. I mean, even if weÂre not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
ThatÂs right! By his uncle too!
===
Okay Bobby, why donÂt we just come over here and let them have a little moment. 
Come here! 
===
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona  ice skating?
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.  
===
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took  pictures of my breasts!
IÂm missinÂ picture time?! 
===
Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have  been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Hey-hey-hey, hey thatÂs your wife youÂre talking about!
===
ItÂs just the pizza place.
You hung up on the pizza place? I donÂt hang up on your friends.
===
IÂm sorry honey, IÂm just having a, having a rough day.
Oh, whatÂs wrong?
===
Oh you really, you really just donÂt want to hear about it.
Then why did I ask?
===
Okay, itÂs justÂand this is really embarrassingÂbut  lately with this whole pregnancy thing IÂm just finding myselfÂhow do I put this  umm, erotically charged.
Is that college talk for horny?
===
Yeah. So yÂknow, I have all of these feelings and I donÂt know  what to do about them, because I canÂt date like a normal person, which is fine  because I donÂt need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.  Just sex, yÂknow? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel  comfortable with and who knows what heÂs doing. For just one great night, I mean is  that really soÂhardÂto find.  So how was your day?
Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
===
Well, I gotta get up early and itÂs almost seven oÂclock.
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
===
Okay, good night!
Good night. 
===
 I didnÂt ask you to do it!
YouÂre Rachel!
===
YouÂre Joey!
YouÂre my friend!
===
Right back at ya!
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
===
And so bad. I donÂt even know what youÂre talking about  because I didnÂt ask you to do anything!
I know!
===
No!
All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
===
ThatÂs the end of this conversation!
This conversation never happened!
===
Never happened! Good night!
Good night!
===
Hey! Oh, IÂm so glad you guys are here. IÂve been dying to tell  someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
 Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
===
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnÂt I  get head of the department? 
Oh! Hey Rach, listen ummÂ
===
Yeah.
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
===
Uh, PaulÂs CafÃ©. They got great food and itÂs really  romantic.
Ooh, great! Thanks!
===
Ooh, I miss dating. GettinÂ all dressed up and going to a fancy  restaurant. IÂm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and itÂs so much fun!  I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not  fun.
Hey, yÂknow what?
===
Huh?
Why donÂt I take you out?
===
What?! Joey, you donÂt want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Yes I do! And weÂre gonna go out, weÂre gonna have a good time,  and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching  outÂ
===
 Okay! IÂll go with ya! IÂll go! IÂll go  with ya.
IÂll be fun.
===
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, IÂm picking you up for our date. These are for you. 
===
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyÂre my favorite. Thank you.
And, a brownie!  Well, half a  brownie. Actually, itÂs just bag. ItÂs been a long walk from the flower shop and  I was startinÂ to feel faint soÂ
===
Yeah, actually thatÂs my roommateÂs.
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
===
Ah yes, but heÂs very protective of me so youÂd better watch  yourself.
AhÂ Hey, so this roommate of yoursÂis he good looking?
===
Hm-mmm.
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
===
 Yeah, but IÂm pretty sure heÂs gay.
No-no-no-no, heÂs not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come  on!
===
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute  the three-pound lobster?
YÂknow what? Bring her both, and IÂll have the same. 
===
Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good dateÂOh, I almost  forgot. I didnÂt pay you the rent check.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? WeÂre on a date.
===
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do  you have any moves?
No! No. Umm, just myself and if they donÂt like me forÂ  IÂm sorry I couldnÂt even get through that.
===
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine  sent to my table from a fan.
===
Oh my God. And that works?!
Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I  just want to have a normal life!"
===
Oh, you poor little famous man.
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night  to kiss you, but youÂre so beautifulÂI donÂt think I can.
===
 Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned  in. I really almost did!
Alright, soÂso tell me one of your moves.
===
Alright. So whereÂd you grow up?
ThatÂs your move? Boy Rach, youÂre lucky youÂre hot.
===
Come on, just answer the question!
 Queens.
===
And so were-were you close to your parents?
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
===
Why not?
I donÂt know. I guess thereÂs just always been this distance  yÂknowÂI mean we both try to pretend itÂs not there, but it is.
===
 Oh.  ItÂs  gotta be rough.
Yeah, it is. ItÂs really tough. YÂknow sometimes I  thinkÂWow!! Nice move!
===
Huh?
"WhereÂd you grow up," itÂs so simple!
===
Thank you! And now if youÂll excuse me, I have to go to the rest  room.
Yeah.
===
And now youÂre watching me walk away.
Yes I am! Again so simple!
===
I am not gonna answer that!
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if  you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
===
No one! They are my friends, I wouldnÂt punch any of them.
Chandler?
===
Yeah, but I donÂt know why. Look at me, IÂm having such a  wonderful time!
Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
===
I know!
I never laughed so hardÂDid you see the wine come out of my nose?
===
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so  much.
===
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Huh. Huh.
===
All right, now donÂt judge me. I normally wait until my date  leaves, but you live here. IÂm ripping into this swan.
Ah! Okay, well then you donÂt judge me. IÂm gonna suck on the  cellophane from the brownie I had before. 
===
So tell me, what are Joey TribbianiÂs end of the night moves?
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips  look irresistible. 
===
How do you do that?
Now you canÂt tell anyone, but uhÂI put on shiny lip balm.
===
Oh my God!
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, IÂm telling ya. Okay all right, so now  you go.
===
No, I donÂt want to tell you.
Why not?
===
Because itÂs embarrassing.
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didnÂt say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just  tell me!
===
 Okay. All right, stand up.  Well, when weÂre  at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a  second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesnÂt sound  like anything, but I swear it works.
 Yeah. WhyÂYeah, that would work for yaÂ
===
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
Oh.  Yeah.  Me to. 
===
Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, IÂm sure I can  make it this time. I justÂI just canÂt be afraid to get a little bitÂhit by  cars. 
Hey!
===
Yeah I know itÂs really boring, but itÂs like a big deal.  Anyway, I was thinking about renting 
Oh yeah? All right, letÂs do it tonight.
===
Well donÂt you have that big date tonight?
Oh right!
===
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
===
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
===
I donÂt know!  IÂm-IÂm kinda thinking it-it was  the lobsterÂ
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
===
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Yeah me too, all night.
===
Really?! How come we didnÂt cross paths?
Yeah well thatÂs because uhÂI stayed in my room. Yeah, you  donÂt want to look in my hamper.
===
Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
No-no! IÂm fine. ItÂs justÂ Hey, can I ask you something?  Have you ever looked at someone that youÂve known for a while and then  suddenlyÂsuddenly see them a different way?
===
You mean like from behind?
Yeah. Yeah, thatÂthatÂs exactly it. YouÂre right. Yeah.
===
Ew, yÂknow what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he  seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
 Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what IÂm talking  about.
===
Totally! Wow!  Would you excuse me for a sec?
Oh yeah, sure.  Ehhh.
===
Oh God! Thank God youÂre home! IÂm watching 
 Alone?!
===
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Hey, did you get to the part where theyÂre trapped in the car and  CujoÂs throwinÂ himself at the windshield?
===
No! No! Seriously, whatÂs wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what  are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
Oh uh, it didnÂt work out.
===
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
===
YÂknow, I never thought IÂd say this about a movie, but I  really hope this dog dies.  What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect  me.
Oh sure, yeah, why not? 
===
Okay.  Okay, thatÂs him! ThatÂs him! ThatÂs  Cujo! ThatÂs Cujo!
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itÂll be okay.
===
Oh my GodÂ.WhatÂs he gonna do now? I canÂt watch!  Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?  ArenÂt you scared?
Terrified. 
===
Oh Joey, IÂm so happy things worked out for us that weÂre having this baby together. I love you so much.
Oh, I love you too.
===
And I hope itÂs not an inappropriate time to say this but, youÂre the best sex I ever had.
ThatÂs always appropriate!  Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
===
 Joey! Joey!
What? WhatÂs going on?
===
Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
AaaahÂ
===
Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Really?!
===
Oh, okay! 
Oh my, oh my God!
===
Aw, itÂs unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, sheÂs like ummÂohÂwhoÂs that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Mia Hamm?
===
Mia Hamm!
Oh thatÂs amazing. 
===
 Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
===
Hey!
Hey Ross! The babyÂs kicking!
===
Last night! I just felt it and I went into JoeyÂs room and he was sleepingÂ
A dreamless sleep.
===
My God, the babyÂs kicking. ThatÂs great. Although IÂkinda wish I-I wouldÂve been there to feel the kicking for the first time yÂknow.
Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.
===
Look, I-I donÂt want to miss anymore baby stuff. SoÂHere. HereÂs my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! IÂll be there! Okay? I donÂt care if itÂs three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
===
I wasnÂt trying to open your closet! I wasnÂt trying to open your closet! I swear! 
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
===
Monica has a secret closet and she wonÂt let me see whatÂs in it.
Why not?
===
I donÂt know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I canÂt see?!
I donÂt know. Ooh, I bet itÂs Richard.
===
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe sheÂs having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
===
And here we goÂ
I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. YÂknow it wouldnÂt kill ya to respect your wifeÂs privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!
===
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I donÂtÂWhoa!! 
Oh hey whoa-whoa, donÂt worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
===
Okay. Oh GodÂOw!ÂOo!
Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everythingÂs gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go.  Oww crushing bones!
===
Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it youÂve had one of these Braxton thingies?
So but everything is normal.
===
Absolutely.
And-and thereÂs no danger to her and the baby?
===
Thank you doctor.   Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
Calm?! I wasnÂt calm! IÂve never been more scared in all my life!
===
But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Well what do I know?! IÂm not a doctor!
===
But IÂBut everything is okay. IÂm fine!
You sure?!
===
Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctorÂs uterus though. Mild discomfort, whatÂs he talking about?
 Oh hey-hey!
===
Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
===
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
Hey uh, whatÂs with the candy?
===
 So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Oh hey, donÂt worry about it man. DonÂt worry about it, no big deal.
===
to be a way!
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
===
Yeah.  Oh no wait, IÂm not an nine-year-old girl.
Then why do you throw like one?
===
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Sure. "Monica."
===
So, howÂs the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I justÂI wish I didnÂt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yÂknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkÂI think Ross feels left out. YÂknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. GodÂ You shouldÂve seen the look on RossÂs face.  By the way, I have no idea what IÂm doing here. For all I know IÂm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
===
ThatÂs a good idea.
Yeah.
===
Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Oh, I justÂI feel terrible.
===
What?! What?! Rach what?!
WhatÂs going on?
===
I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
===
Yeah, IÂll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
IÂm on it! 
===
I canÂt believe this! I shouldnÂt be the one making her throw up!
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
===
 Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
===
WhatÂs up?
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
===
 Are you breaking up with us?
The thing isÂÂcause I live with Rachel IÂm here for a lot of the stuff, okay?  And RossÂRoss is missing everything. SoÂ
===
Yeah?
Maybe you two should live together.
===
Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatÂif youÂre gonna have a roommate, yÂknow it might as well be the father.
===
So? Sure! But it-it wouldnÂt be anything romantic. And IÂm-IÂm dating MonaÂDamnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
All right now, so? What do you think?
===
No! No itÂs not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Well, I was due.
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
So RachelÂs all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnÂt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, itÂs a couple weeks past itÂs expiration date, so itÂs got a bit of a kick.
===
Are you okay?
Are you kidding me? IÂm great! Yeah, IÂm uh; IÂm better than great. I am good. And now that sheÂs gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldnÂt do before. YÂknow? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. YÂknow? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. YÂknow? I like being on my own, IÂm uh, better off this way. IÂm uh, a lone wolf. YÂknow? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. WhatÂs a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! 
===
 Did you umÂIÂm sorry, did you just say itÂs Rachel?
Yes.
===
Um, youÂyou like Rachel?
Yes. I like Rachel.
===
Rachel?!
 Yeah, okay but look, buy uhÂHey-hey, yÂknow, yÂknow who else I like? You! And it-it doesnÂt get said enough. I like you Ross.
===
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 
Yeah, but itÂs not a big deal.
===
ItÂs not a big deal? Oh, IÂm sorry I justÂum, IÂwhat about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I likeÂyou-you canÂt stop thinking about her. Like how you canÂt sleep?
IÂm an actor, yÂknow? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
===
Rachel whoÂs carrying my baby? Rachel?
Look no, I-I know itÂs bad, and I know itÂs wrong. Okay? But-but itÂs not like anythingÂs ever gonna happen. YÂknow? These-these are just feelings, theyÂre gonna go away.
===
YÂknow what? I-I gotta go. 
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross donÂtÂ
===
Hey.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
===
No, I donÂt want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me?
===
No.
 Bite me?
===
No, no I donÂt want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that IÂm not mad at you andÂand that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. 
Oh nowÂHey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
===
UhÂyeah sure. 
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I donÂtÂ
===
Okay.
 Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uhÂI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. 
===
What?! YouÂre in love with her.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
===
Umm, no.
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I donÂt want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, IÂll get over this." YÂknow? I justÂIt just keeps gettinÂ harder. I donÂt, I donÂt know what to do. YÂknow? What do I do?
===
I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Okay thatÂs the green stuff talkinÂ.
===
No, IÂm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if sheÂs not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
But what if uhÂand IÂm not saying she will beÂButÂ
===
If she is where you are then uhÂthen my feeling weird about it shouldnÂt stand in the way.
Are you sure?
===
Yeah. Look if-if sheÂs gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldnÂt find a better guy. SoÂ
Hey thanks.
===
So when do you think youÂre gonna talk to her?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I havenÂt even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
===
IÂm understanding, but letÂs not get carried away.
IÂm sorry, youÂre right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!
===
Joey? WhatÂs up?
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
===
Okay whatÂs up?
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
===
Well honey, IÂm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that IÂwant to have dinner with you tonight. ThatÂs all.
===
Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? 
Okay. ThatÂs good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what youÂre gonna say. Good. Yeah.  DonÂt you people ever knock?!
===
Âand I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean IÂm really worried the babyÂs not going to like him.  Are you okay?
What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reasonÂÂIs it hot in here?
===
No. Not-not for me, but why donÂt you take off your sweater?
I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
===
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Yeah. Sure. 
===
Huh. Wow, I wouldnÂt think Hobbs would like that so much.
UhÂ How long have we known each other?
===
years. Wow.
Uh-huh, long time.
===
Yeah.
But over the past few weeksÂ
===
Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonightÂ
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
===
So you were saying?
IÂm not quite sure.
===
Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and ummÂnow here we are.
Yeah, here we are. UhhÂ IÂ I think IÂmÂfalling in love with you.
===
 What?
IÂm falling in love with you.
===
 Who are you talking too? Oh, youÂre kidding! Oh, itÂs a joke!  ItÂs funny. ItÂs funny. I donÂt get it.  Oh.  Okay. UmmÂ I-IÂuh, wow. Are you uhÂ How did ummÂ When?
Does it really matter?
===
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You donÂt have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  Okay, you gotta say something!
===
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but IÂ
But. 
===
Joey.
Yeah-yeah right. ThatÂs okay. ThatÂs fine. ThatÂs uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, itÂs no big deal. All right? I think IÂm gonna go. 
===
No! Joey please! Please donÂt! Please donÂt leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! 
DonÂt start doing that. You canÂt do that Rach, Âcause then youÂre gonna make me do that.  Oh, here we go! 
===
Can I? 
Sure! 
===
Oh Joey honey I donÂtÂI donÂt want to loseÂ
Hey-hey-hey, hey! You canÂt. Okay? Ever!
===
IÂm so sorry.
Oh no-no Rach, please, donÂt be sorry. Okay? DonÂt be sorry.  YÂknow I was only kidding you.
===
to talk to her!
No-no, I canÂt! I canÂt! Not after the other night, itÂs just itÂsÂtoo weird, okay? DonÂt tell her IÂm here!  DonÂt eat that! 
===
 Okay, did you hear that?
Yeah, a naked bagel game?   Dude, I donÂt know. ThatÂs a pretty small hole.
===
Honey, you gotta talk to her.
I canÂt! YÂknow? You guys donÂt know what itÂs like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
===
Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when theyÂre hungry.
All right so, so what do I do?
===
This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know itÂs weird, itÂs awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on yourÂ
===
Hi!
Hey.
===
Hi.
Hi.
===
They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.
 Hey!
===
Yeah Joey sheÂsÂRachelÂs got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow!  YÂknow what, if weÂre gonna make dinner weÂre gonna have to leave. Yeah. 
So you uh, have aÂbig work problem?
===
Yeah itÂs ummÂ Yeah itÂs uhÂ It-itÂs yÂknowÂItÂs nothing.
Huh. Okay.  So uh, I think IÂm gonna take off.
===
YeahÂNo wait! Joey no wait it is. ItÂs something. ItÂs-itÂs ummÂitÂs my boss.
Yeah?
===
Yeah, and umm my baby.
Yeah?
===
My boss wants to buy my baby!
What?! Oh my-oh my God!
===
I know I told you, itÂs a really big problem.
What he wants to buy your baby?!
===
Can you believe that?!
ThatÂs crazy!
===
ThatÂs what I told him!
Okay, how did this even happen?
===
Well IÂll tell ya!  See uh my-my boss and his wifeÂThey-they canÂt have children. So umm, and thatÂwe were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
===
May I help you?
my friends baby?!
===
Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guyÂs not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
===
 What?
LetÂs just say I took care of it.
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa, letÂs say more!
DonÂt worry! DonÂt worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You donÂt go buying peopleÂs babies, so back off!!"
===
No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesnÂt want to buy my baby! I made that up!
What?! Why?!
===
So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldnÂt be awkward!
And you couldnÂt think of anything else?!
===
Oh Joey, I canÂt believe you brought my boss into this! IÂm gonna get fired!
You lied to me!
===
Hi.
So? What-what-what happened?
===
Joey, IÂm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make thingsÂ
I know. I know.
===
It kinda worked. I mean yÂknow, I donÂt know about you buy I havenÂt thought about our thing since all this.
Hey youÂre right. Yeah, itÂs kinda been like us again a little bit.
===
Yeah I know! I miss that.
Me too. I mean IÂhavenÂt thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didnÂt feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
===
Sure. Yeah.
So, whoÂs the guy?
===
No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what theyÂll say this year? "God, you"
Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.  IÂm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. 
===
Really you can do that?
Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I canÂt do it with you guys watching me!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
You got a present for my parents. ThatÂs so sweet.
wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them. 
===
Aww that is so cool.
And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
===
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I donÂt want him complimenting my thing.
===
I feel terrible.
I know
===
Then you better do it now.
Why?
===
Because IÂm going to kill him
What-what? 
===
Are you sure it wasnÂt an oyster?
I guess it couldÂve been, I didnÂt really look at it. YÂknow, I just wiped it on ChandlerÂs coat and got the hell out of there.
===
HeÂs just such a great guy IÂm so excited about him.
Oh hey, you should be excited about him. ThereÂs nothing wrong with him heÂs a good guy. 
===
You think?
Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
===
YouÂre right. YouÂre right, heÂs just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! IÂm a sunny, positive person. 
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
===
WhatÂs that now?
NothingÂ
===
How cool is this?! We know three down! IÂm touching three down! 
Yeah you are baby.
===
So did they call you to tell you your nameÂs gonna be in this?
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
===
WhyÂd you say no?
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
===
Okay, donÂt listen to him. Please?
Fine! All right, IÂll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I yÂknow, start to say something stupid.
===
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
===
 YÂknow I think its great you wanted to meet here. YÂknow when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
 Actually, I didnÂt know the magazine was paying for it. WouldnÂt have mattered, IÂm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
===
Umm, IÂll have a cup of coffee.
And IÂll have all the muffins.
===
A mentoÂ
Right.
===
Like the candy?
Matter of fact, I do.
===
Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
===
Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Yeah!
===
Your muffins. 
IÂll take those to go.  For the kids.
===
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnÂt have said. But believe me, thatÂs not gonna happen today.
===
Understood. So, whatÂd you say back then?
Well, I said that IÂ 
===
Umm, IÂm gonna just go get this warmed up. 
Okay.
===
Mento?
No thanks.
===
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
No thatÂs all right. DonÂt worry about it.
===
Oh but look! ThatÂs gonna leave a stain! 
Rach! Hey! ItÂs fine! YouÂre at JoeyÂs!
===
Really?
Yeah! Look! 
===
IÂve never lived like this before.
I know.
===
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
===
So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
Really? Me? Wow! I donÂt even know any huge gay people!
===
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so weÂre face to face or-or should I climb down your back so weÂre-weÂre butt to face.
I think face to face.
===
I would say that.
Face to face, yeah!
===
Okay, here I go.
All right. 
===
Oh, please!
 Hey, how you doinÂ?
===
 He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
IÂd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. SheÂs sleeping.  Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? 
===
And thatÂs Phoebe , and thatÂs Joey.
Hey,  how you doinÂ?
===
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
===
I don't think so.
Oh, I do.  How you doin?
===
I'm okay.
What?!?! Oh dear God!
===
So, thatÂs it. I guess thatÂs all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Oh great! Great! Thank you. 
===
Bye.
Bye-bye.  I did it!
===
 Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than 
Oh, I donÂt watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, yÂknow?
===
will be happy to hear that.
Oh, good to know.  So close!
===
Wow! I canÂt believe they didnÂt put it in the part where you said you didnÂt watch soap operas.
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
===
You slept with her didnÂt you?
Little bit, yeah.
===
Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Oh yeah, thatÂs just a little something for my huge gay fan base. 
===
Did you just wink at me?
Hey, youÂre the one that loves the picture.
===
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
Oh no, I canÂt go. IÂm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
===
ThatÂs great.
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day IÂll  Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night IÂll be  Joey Trrrribbiani!
===
YouÂll be perfect for this! ThatÂs already your name!
But the auditionÂs in a couple hours and I donÂt even understand the game.
===
Well do you want some help?
Oh really? ThatÂd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
===
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
 All right! LetÂs play Bamboozled!
===
Bamboozled?
Yeah, isnÂt that a cool name?
===
 No!
All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why donÂt you tell us a little something about you Ross?
===
Well uh, I-IÂm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben!  And uhÂ
I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
===
Well Joey, IÂm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! 
Excellent! LetÂs play Bamboozled! Chandler, youÂll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
===
Bogota.
ItÂs Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
===
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
I should know that. LetÂs see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
===
Higher or lower than what?
This is embarrassing. 
===
The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, IÂll take another question. 
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
===
ItÂs okay, IÂm ready.
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youÂre ready to answer the question.
===
This is ridiculous, heÂs not gonna hold his breathÂ 
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, TrisÂHoly cow, thatÂs a big word. TriscÂ Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
===
Let me see that.
This one right here. 
===
 The fear of 
No! No, fear of the number 13.
===
ItÂs possible, they have really sharp edges.
All right Chandler, youÂre up.
===
Oh come on Ross, I think weÂre all losers here.
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
===
Let me think. Let me thinkÂOh! I donÂt care.
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
===
Either, it makes no difference.
Choose, you jackass!
===
IÂll take a card.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of RossÂs points!
===

Correct! ThereÂs a possible backwards bonus!
===
Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Yes!
===
IÂd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Wise choice, how many rungs?
===
Six!
 That noise can only me one thing.
===
Shut up! 
Yes! Yes, youÂre back in the lead!
===
 Oh come on!!
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
===
Is there a hopping bonus?
Of course!
===
Ben Franklin.
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
===
Queen Victoria.
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
===
Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Now, over to Chandler.
===
IÂd like a Google Card.
Are you sure?
===
Yes!  No!  Google!
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youÂve been Bamboozled!
===
Hey Joey, hi! IÂm Ray; IÂm the producer of the show.
 ItÂs a pleasure to meet you Ray.
===
And this is Duncan  and Erin, theyÂre gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, letÂs get the camera rolling.
 Rightie-O Ray!
===
Whenever youÂre ready.
 Hello, IÂm Joey Tribbiani! LetÂs play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
===
Wayne Gretzky.
Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
===
Uh Joey, didnÂt your agents give you the revised rules? WeÂve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
WhatÂWhy?!
===
Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didnÂt follow it.
Well whatÂs complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! YouÂre in Paradise Pond!
===
Yeah all thatÂs gone. ItÂs basically just a simple question and answer game now.
Well whatÂs fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game thatÂs just people standing around answering questions?
===
Well, thereÂll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
 LetÂs play Bamboozled!
===
No!
Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And IÂm not just saying this because IÂm your friend, IÂm sayinÂ it Âcause itÂs the truth. YouÂre food is abysmal!
===
We said at the movies, butÂ
Okay, IÂll see you there.  
===
Joey!  Now that youÂre hereÂ
Sure, I can hang out Âtil I have to meet ya.  What uhÂHow come youÂre not going?
===
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.
===
And people say you donÂt pay attention. No, this is a much better job. ItÂs vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
===
Hey Joey, come taste this.
What is it?
===
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? WellÂ  IÂm getting my revenge!
You cooked him?
===
I donÂt see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Either eat it, or be in it.
===
IÂm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. 
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; thereÂs a new class cominÂ in.
===
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
===
And the cream?
Cheese makes me thirsty.
===
Okay. LetÂs move on.
All right.
===
Okay Joey, youÂre up next.  This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
I can an A? In-in school?  Hey, IÂm a dork.
===
If youÂre a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
Yeah!
===
Okay then, I donÂt stink. IÂm a good chef. Okay. 
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I donÂt want to go. IÂm having fun.
===
Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says itÂs time to go, itÂs time to go. 
===
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
What the hell!
===
Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Oh, itÂs a poster for that World War I movie that IÂm in, check it out.
===
violent!
Uh-huh! I know. IÂm coming soon to a theater near you! IÂm in THX! IÂm unsuitable for children!
===
Now I cannot wait to see this.
Yeah, yeah, itÂs already generating Oscar buzz.
===
I started that!
I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and youÂre all invited! 
===
Are we gonna take a limo?
Sure! Why not?!
===
Joey! ItÂs Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
===
Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up?  Hello?
 Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
===
 What-what about me?
You said you didnÂt want to go.
===
I donÂt. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because IÂm pregnant you think IÂm invisible.
Definitely not invisible.
===
Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe, Phoebe.
Well uhÂI think I want to take Chandler.
===
You really want to take me?
Yeah! Yeah! I mean IÂm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yÂknow Chandler always supported my career. HeÂs paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
===
Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youÂre gonna take him? Joey, I donÂt think youÂre comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
ItÂs not just the stuff he paid for, I mean itÂs-itÂs everything. YÂknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnÂt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnÂt believe in myself.
===
I always knew you were gonna make it. IÂm so proud of you.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
===
Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
 IÂm gonna go shave. 
===
This is so exciting! ItÂs so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
A little tall.
===
What?
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?  There you go. 
===
 "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along." 
 Okay, this is it. ItÂs my big fight scene coming up. 
===
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
You liked it? You really liked it?
===
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Which part exactly?
===
The whole thing! Can we go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
===
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
===
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnÂt take any of my suggestions! ThatÂs for coming buddy. IÂll see you later. 
===
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
 Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
===
IÂm so sorry.
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? YouÂve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
===
What?!
Give me a number, I donÂt want to owe you anything!
===
You donÂt owe me anything, I donÂt want you moneyÂ
Ah-ah-ah! WeÂre doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
===
I donÂt know, five hundred dollars?
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
===
Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Okay, so thatÂs another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thatÂsÂ 
===
Do you want a calculator?
Please! 
===
Here! 
All right, what else?
===
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classesÂ
Which weÂre still keeping under our hats!
===
Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican. 
What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man."
===
Yes, money well spent!
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
===
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, foodÂ
Okay. Okay, so IÂm writing you a check forÂSo you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
===
Hi!
Hey! You made it!
===
Oh, this is fun.
YouÂre ready to have a baby? My boyÂs all grown up!
===
ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
 What?! Are you crazy?!
===
Right. And with who again? 
God. HeÂs crazy! Why doesnÂt he want to be with Rachel?
===
I know!
I mean seriously, sheÂs like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadnÂt and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms andÂ  I havenÂt bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
===
Oh, it ate your money?
 No.
===
All right, IÂll see you downstairs then.
All right.
===
All right.
Hey I got one! I got one!
===
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
 Uh, you gotta press the button. 
===
IÂm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staffÂ
 Uh, sheÂs with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
===
Dr. Drake who?
Remoray. ItÂs Portuguese. We need that information; IÂm a doctor.
===
A doctor at this hospital?
Damnit woman weÂre losing precious time! Now do you want this manÂs blood on your head?
===
Hands.
Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. HeÂs a patient of mine, IÂve been treating him for years!
===
HeÂs in room 816.
816, thank you! 
===
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thatÂs him! ThatÂs him!
Great! Go get him.
===
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
 HeÂs not really my type.
===
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whatÂs he like. People tell doctors everything.
But you said he was this great guy!
===
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
You do attract some stinkers.
===
Really? IÂve been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know, but IÂm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
===
Dr. Wells is a woman.
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
===
Clifford Burnett.
Date of birth? 
===
November 16
Age?
===
CanÂt you figure that out based on my date of birth?
IÂm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
===
IÂm 33.
Okay. And uh, are you married.
===
No.
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
===
Are all the questions this personal?
 Yes.
===
Well uh if you must know IÂm a widower.
Oh thatÂs terrible. IÂm-IÂm really sorry.
===
Yeah.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
===
No.
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yÂknow, sexually?
===
No!
Oooh, wrong answer. 
===
What else? What else?
Uh, well heÂs 33.
===
Oh. Ah-uh.
A widower.
===
Oh.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and heÂs not into anything weird sexually.
===
Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
 RachelÂs having her baby!!  Which is of no interest to me, IÂm a neurologist.
===
I donÂt believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello? 
===
I donÂt think so.
Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brotherÂs triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
===
Uh Joey, weÂre trying to dial down the crazy.
Right!
===
It doesnÂt happen to me either.
Me neither.
===
Hi!
There she is!
===
ItÂs incredible, I mean one minute sheÂs inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
 She looks so real!  YÂknow what I mean! SheÂs this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees andÂuh-oh.
===
What?
Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so weÂre good.
===
So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I donÂt see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. 
WhatÂs the matter now?
===
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
What was the other one Ross?
===
Nothing.
What is it? Hey!
===
Really itÂs nothing. IÂm justÂ
Rach come on, what?
===
IÂve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
===
Oh please, heÂll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
===
IÂm just saying that yÂknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andÂheÂs gonna have his own life. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
===
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
gonna be alone. Okay? I promise thatÂs not gonna happen.
===
Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? TheyÂre right on that chair under RossÂs coat.
Sure.
===
So uhÂI guess we shouldÂmake it official huh?
UhÂ Look RachÂ Hey Ross is here! Hey look! ItÂs my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
===
Hey you.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but IÂm really more of a candy guy. 
===
Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
No.
===
What?
Oh, IÂm sorry. I meant no.
===
I know, I still need to talk to you.
Oh hey but, before you guys do that  I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
===
Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my 
 Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
===
Sure.
Dude I just did something terrible.
===
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
===
What?! Why does she think that?
Because it kinda looked like I did.
===
Again, what?!
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my handÂ
===
As we all are at some point during the day.
It wasnÂt my ring! It fell out of RossÂs jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
===
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
I guess.
===
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
I know! I know itÂs awful.
===
Well, what did she say?
 She said yes.
===
Does Ross know?
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
===
Well maybe you donÂt have to tell him anything.
Oh, I like that. YeahÂ
===
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
 Now letÂs not get carried away. 
===
Especially Ross!
 Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yÂknow what? IÂll-IÂll come back later. 
===
YÂknow what? I donÂt like you without mom.  Come on. 
 WeÂre not peeking? 
===
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring IÂitÂs beautiful I love it!
Yeah uh look Rach, thereÂs something I gotta tell ya.
===
ItÂs all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but donÂt worry. ItÂll happen.
 Yowsa! 
===
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Dear Lord.
===
IÂm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think thatÂ
===
Oh look, sheÂs pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. DoesnÂt she look scared?
YÂknow, I donÂt really know her.
===
Why donÂt we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. 
 Are you kidding me?!
===
ItÂs just so frustrating! Why doesnÂt she want my breast?!
I donÂt know! Maybe sheÂs crazy! 
===
You still havenÂt told Rachel you werenÂt really proposing?
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
===
Joey, you have to tell her whatÂs going on! And what did it look like?!
I didnÂt look at it. Stupid babyÂs head was blocking most of it.
===
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Look, itÂs not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I donÂt want to hurt her.
===
Okay, look, just do it gently.
YouÂre right. YouÂre right. I-IÂll go tell her now before Ross finds out and IÂll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
===
Joey proposed to you?
I can come back.
===
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
No.
===
Yes you did!
Actually, technically, I didnÂt.
===
Wait! Whoa-whoa, youÂyou gave her the ring?
No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
===
Yes, you did!
No, I didnÂt!
===
Yes, you did!
No, I didnÂt!
===
Yes, you did! And donÂt you say, "No, I didnÂt!"
Ahhh!
===
Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didnÂtÂI didnÂt propose!
===
Yeah, what did happen?
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
===
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
No, I didnÂt!
===
Yes, you did!
No, I didnÂt!
===
Yes, you didÂOh my God you didnÂt!  Well then why didnÂt you tell me that before?!
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
===
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
 IÂll tell you about it later. Be cool.
===
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
It wasnÂt my ring! ItÂs RossÂs ring! ThatÂs why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
===
But I-I was going to see if yÂknow, maybe you uh, start dating again but thatÂI mean that-that was all, Rach.
Dude, step up! I proposed.
===
No, you didnÂt!
Oh thatÂs right. ThereÂs a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
===
 I canÂt believe you told her I was going to propose!
I canÂt believe youÂre not going to propose!
===
Hey, IÂm not going to rush into anything!
Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
===
SheÂs doing it Look, sheÂs breast-feeding look!
 Ah, itÂs beautiful.
===
Wonderful weird.
YÂknow what you guys? IÂm uh, IÂm gonna go too. And uh, IÂm sorry about everything.
===
Honey donÂt worry, it was my mistake.
No, Rach, I shouldÂve told you sooner. ItÂs just thatÂMan! That kid is going to town! 
===
Ooooo!
 Hey you guys IÂm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
===
Rachel said sheÂd marry you?!
 This isnÂt the right room, sorry folks. 
===
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?
WhyÂre you so tired?
===
CouldnÂt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldnÂt sleep.Â  YÂknow? I was like, if I fall asleep now IÂll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now IÂll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldnÂt fall asleep.
You know what you shouldÂve done, you should have told yourself that little story.
===
Oh Ah!  Oh my gosh thereÂs something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people thinkÂ  Oh you guys I love it.
Hey so whereÂs Ross?
===
HeÂs downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Is he still mad at us?
===
Well, you more then me, but he canÂt stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
ThatÂs not fair! I canÂt do that.
===
Yeah, IÂm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
See this is what I was afraid of, I didnÂt think I should be here either but somebody  said heÂd be over it by now.
===
Huh? Ooh  you mean like aÂ Huh?
 Hey.  Ross, I know youÂre pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
===
 What!  You didnÂt do anything wrong?!
I said I didnÂt technically.
===
Okay letÂs put aside that you  "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  I donÂt really know what that means.  You were saying?
===
And I can even understand that you couldnÂt tell Rachel, but why couldnÂt you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didnÂt.
I know I shouldÂve.  "IÂm sorry." 
===
IÂm gonna go.
No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
===
Give me the bag.
No, look, I donÂt know what else to do. I said IÂm sorry!
===
Joey!
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
===
IÂm not gonna hit you.
Why not?Â  YouÂll feel better!Â  IÂll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
===
No I donÂt.
A little bit.
===
No.
Little bit.
===
No!
 A little bit more.
===
Give me the bag.
No, hit me
===
Give me the bag.
Hit me.
===
Joey, give me the bag.
Hit me!
===
Joe IÂm not kiddingÂ
 Hit me, hit me.
===
No!
 Hit me! Hit me! 
===
You ducked!!
IÂm sorry! It was a reflex! 
===
Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
I couldnÂt help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! 
===
What is the matter with you?!?
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didnÂt you duck?
===
Why donÂt we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Good, good yeah,  maybe while weÂre there, they can check your reflexes.   "Oops."
===
I broke my thumb.
Your thumb? ThatÂs weird.  You sure youÂre punching right? Make a fist.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
===
You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. 
You, you want me to help you with that?
===
Why, does it look like IÂm having trouble with my misshapen claw? 
Name?  I know Ross but whatÂs it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
===
Just Ross!
ItÂs pretty, Okay date of birth?
===
You know my birthday.
Sure, May...tember.
===
October 18th.
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
===
Actually IÂm a palianÂ Dinosaurs is fineÂ the drawing is not.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
===
Ah, Rachel I guess.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
===
Just ahÂ just put roommate.
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, youÂre gonna get together right?
===
I donÂt think that we are.
But you two were supposed to be together.
===
Well, I thought so too, but then she said sheÂd marry you.
Come on, Ross, that didnÂt mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
===
Yeah thatÂs what she said.
So?
===
So I donÂt wanna be just anybody.
Wow.
===
You know what, itÂs, itÂs better this way anyway. I mean I donÂt know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. ItÂs just much easier if weÂre just friends who have a kid.
Really?
===
Yeah.
And youÂre Okay with that?
===
Yes. I mean, itÂs what we always planned.Â  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.Â  ThatÂs why they call them plans.Â  Hello?  IÂm fine.
Hey, for what itÂs worth, with Rachel I donÂt think youÂll ever be just  "anybody."
===
Hey there you go! 
 "Thanks."
===
 Hey, what you guys talking about?
Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? 
===
Monday?!
How long do you have to go for?
===
They said it could be up to a year.
A year?!
===
There is nothing like the support of your loving   wife, huh?
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot,   but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
===
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be   able to make it.
We were gonna go see the Jets!
===
Not you.
I can't believe you guys are moving.
===
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener. 

===
Every time? 
Uhuh.
===
I'm on the phone!  Dr. Wiener? 

===
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.   It's just so grown up.
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person   named Wiener, God that kills me. 
===
Look at you all grown up.
Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with   Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.   You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks   aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
===
You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date!
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
===
Done. Oh good, really?
Yeah! 
===
Let's see!  Oh, you know   who's great? Sandy Poophack. 
 Poophack... 
===
Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller

===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
So how is this for our big double date tonight? 
 Oh my God!
===
Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for. 
Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget? 
===
Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.   She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,   but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy. 
No.
===
Come on, give me something. What's his name?
Mike.
===
Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
===
 
Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why   couldn't I have said...  There's no guy in   there! 
===
Yeah? 
 Okay! 
===
I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with   you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I   should be open and taking some risks.
Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?   All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
===
I am Mike.
Atta boy!
===
How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a   nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
 From school.
===
Well, I'm a lawyer.
Mike, 'attorney at law'!
===
Actually, I just gave up my practice.
What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
===
Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law   thing, so...
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to   Mike.
===
I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
===
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have   known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.   Mike hit my mom with a car.
===
No, I didn't.
That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're   friends again everything's great!
===
What?!
What?!
===
Do you not know each other?
 Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that   we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.   We played all kinds of games.  Hey, remember the one where I punch   you in the face for not being cool?!
===
 Six!
What are you doing? I said seven!     Argh!!!
===
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
===
Who are you kidding?  You just find some   guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like   this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!
===
It was nice meeting you!
 You're leaving too?
===
I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
Good night! 
===
Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you   out?

===
 Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,   that would be nice.
Look at this. My two best friends!
===
 What's the   matter Joe?
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big   leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
===
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make   all this easier?
Dude, you see right thru me!!  
===
Can I talk now?
Okay, bye. 
===
Joey?
He had to board. 
===
excuse me?
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
===
oh I thought you said Hi.
that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
===
I'm Hayley.
look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in   coffeehouses
===
HA!
 gesundheit
===
I would love to go out with you.
really, great, did I actually ask you?
===
HA!
 seriously Gunther you should see   someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE! 
===
what a great dinner.
yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that   last piece of cake at the restaurant.
===
 your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get   you anything?
do you have any cake?
===
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
 Hey
===
 Hi
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night   and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
===
so basically you've slept with all the woman in   New York and now you're just going around again.
well that's not even the weird part. I don't think   she remembered sleeping with me.
===
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
and who's fault is that.
===
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember   who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again   and try to get past it  OH SALT BLOATY!
===
What?
How could you not remember that we slept together?
===
What! When?
I dunno!
===
I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
come on, come on, search your brain all right. it   was  a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had   sex  here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
===
no it's not ringing any bells.
my god woman! How many people do you have to had been   with not to remember any of this?
===
Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember   me Hey! I still got it.  so were good.  I'll let myself out.
===
you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your     whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious     relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you     go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience     never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
your right! I love my life!  I actually did sleep with   her.
===
Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you   talk to the queen. 
wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those   horses can crap. 
===
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime   soap Days of Our Lives? 
Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I   can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. 
===
What are you going to do?
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really   good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.   They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00   AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot. 
===
Hey, what's going on Joe? 
I.. I.. I need a good lie.
===
Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on   the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people! 
No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't   at a work thing today.
===
Ooh, honey. You stink at lying. 
I do not.
===
Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good   lie. I'll help you practice it.
Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you. 
===
"Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Oh.. man..
===
Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.   but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when   you're talking, people know you're lying. 
Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..   I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. 
===
No, honey, its. thats a special plate.Â  See   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. 
I can't believe I won.
===
Sure, Monica would have to give her up. 
I lie better then that, right?
===
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's   easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the   parade because you had a family emergency. 
Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because   I had a family emergency.
===
Oh wait.. What are you doing? 
Setting the table. 
===
How hard could it be? You do it. 
ooh oooh.. 
===
Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello   on them. 
===
Maybe not even then. 
Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had   a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie   Pheebs.
===
Bye plates!
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? 
===
What? Something happened with the plates?
Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came   in...
===
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
 Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
===
Oh, I like my job.
I *love* my job.
===
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
===
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Uh-huh.
===
You guuuyys.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
===
BE-LOW me!
Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
===
Oh my god...
Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
===
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
===
Monica.
Got ya. 
===
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
===
Hey
Hey. So where's Mon?
===
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
And you're not helping?
===
Hey you guys!
 Hey! Happy birthday ...
===
Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Hi.
===
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
===
Nice to meet you guys .
Yeah, you too.
===
And Joey?
How do you think she's doing?
===
You mean, when you were a baby.
Sure.
===
I think it's sweet. 
Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
===
 Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if    you didn't go after her.
Why not?
===
Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything    to, you know, drive her away.
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call    her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds    about right.
===
Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just    forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told    me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
===
What are you, a child?
Yes!
===
Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy    on someone else.
Fine. 
===
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
===
Your thoughts? Plural?
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta    see her!
===
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!    She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
===
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the    world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
===
Great novels? 
Fine ... mediocre porn
===
Yeah, sure!
Oh ...  Happy birth ...  oh, see you    later 
===
So where did you study?
Oh, I didn't go to college.
===
No, where did you study acting?
Molly ... people don't study acting ...
===
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair.    What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?    Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
===
Come on! Joe!
Ok 
===
Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have    no problem.
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The    princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
===
Hey Joey!
Hey!
===
 Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's   not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always   a mistake.
===
But Chandler lent you money!
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
===
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Oh...how much?
===
Two thousand dollars?
Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
===
Yeah...
That's right I am! 
===
Hi you guys!
Hey!
===
Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this   place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment.
Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when   I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or   er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
===
No. I was just going to do this myself. 
You're gonna do it?
===
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Oh, women can. You can't.
===
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
The hardware store is right down the street.
===
Hey Joe!
Hey!
===
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything   about it.
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
===
And that would have made the official party line.  Monica   and I are having a little financial trouble.
Yeah, I know.
===
What? What do you mean you know?
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and   the economy is bad.
===
Oh! Right.
 That's the fastest I have ever thought!
===
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
===
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! 
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your   rent is. 
===
Oh ok.
 I am on fire!
===
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her.
===
What?
Something personal.
===
Excuse me.
Boob job.
===
I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would   be crazy.
===
Joey's apartment. Joey enters carrying a tub of ice cream. He sets   it on the table, takes off his jacket and struggles with the drawer. It cannot   be opened.]
Rach?!  Rachel!!!!?  So I can't do anything I like????
===
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Because she is!
===
Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
===
It's over/Joe!
OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any   bigger?
===
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
===
Right. Except that I do want to get married.
 Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
===
Ok... so... Goodbye.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
===
Joey's apartment. Joey is struggling with the fridge. He finally gets   it open and falls on the floor]
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...  Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able   to get in here again!
===
Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Hey Ross, check this out!  yeah, I can't do that!
===
You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Hey! 
===
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
 No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
===
 Alright, let's go!
Dude! 
===
I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
 aaand SEND! 
===
Hey! How was basketball?
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
===
Oh, no! Who did that?
Chandler... hey...  Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? 
===
She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
 Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
===
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount... 
===
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
===
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
===
What are you doing?
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
===
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
 There you go sweetie...   This isn't over.
===
Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!
===
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
===
Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... 
Make the transfer! 
===
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
===
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
But he's the same.
===
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
But he's the same.
===
Joey, come on!
He's the same!
===
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Original or crappy?
===
Original.
No, sorry haven't seen him.
===
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
It's Monica, ok?
===
That's not Monica!
Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
===
 Oh God.
... she's being unreasonable!
===
 Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much  Oh don't cover its ears!  It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
It does?
===
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Really? She... she loves me?
===
Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .
Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.
===
Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma, look who's baaack!
Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.
===
Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
How do you think I got him in the first place?
===
 God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
===
I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a  cantaloupe might hurt less.
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
===
Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
===
 Are you serious?
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
===
Hey, that was an honest mistake!
Right!"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" 
===
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
===
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
===
Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
Oh, wish me luck!
===
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
===
On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!
Drake! What are you doing in here?
===
Get out!
You don't love him!
===
What do you know about love?
I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
===
That kiss never happened.
Oh, what about this one.
===
No, I told you...get out!
Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
===
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
===
I don't have a choice...
Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.
===
Don't say that...
Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. 
===
Hi!
Hey!
===
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
===
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
===
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
===
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
I can't believe you married him.
===
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a 
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
===
to accept that.
How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
===
 Kiss me.
What?
===
Kiss me.
Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
===
No, I'm saying...
but, but..
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
 Oh man! I thought I got it all!
===
 How...how...?
I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? 
===
uh-huh
And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! 
===
 Wow...definitely just Drake...
What?
===
What...how is it going with Drake?
Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
===
What...that scene I saw was so good!
Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
===
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
===
So?
So...I've never played that!
===
Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
Uh...well...just once...with you...
===
Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
 What the hell are you talking about??
===
 Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
 Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
===
 Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
===
 Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
===
What is it?
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
===
I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
===
What? How come that you don't have to go!
early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
===
 Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
 Hey, here you go.
===
 Nobody, forget it!
 Maybe.
===
 Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
 Hey!
===
Hey!
What's happenin'?
===
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
===
"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" 
 Stupid Jane Rogers!!
===
 You are having a party tonight??
Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
===
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
I do it every year.
===
You do that every year??
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
===
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Yeah...
===
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Yeah...
===
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
 I can't believe you guys went for that one!
===
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
===
Well, then so you just invite me...!
 Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
===
Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
===
No, I arranged that...
 Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
===
We know about your party Joey.
What party?
===
The game's over! Take off your robe!
 Ok... I mean...
===
No!! Cover it up!!
 Nice to meet ya! 
===
 I love you!
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
===
Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
It's a science.
===
Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
===
That's it, just sign right on the bra .
Monica!
===
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
 What have you got there?
===
Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Ah, let me see!  Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
===
 I think I am.
 Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
===
guys?
Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
===
Joey, you're so sweet.
That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
===
Who ?
Me.
===
 What?  Really?
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
===
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! 
Gotcha.
===
Oh, Very funny... Joey.
enjoy the play?
===
No.
 Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
===
 So, a professor, uh?
Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious    .  That's not    how she used it...?
===
Yeah, I know the type.
Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.    No? Am I getting close?
===
Hi!
Come on in, how are ya?
===
I'm good!
Can I offer you a drink?
===
So I am just so excited to be    here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
Hey, if you need a tour guide... 
===
fun
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
===
Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher    Hall.
 Ok!
===
And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display    at the public library.
I know, yeah!
===
And first, I have to see the MET!
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna    see the Yankees.
===
No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
Which one, they all suck!
===
The museum!
 I don't think so.
===
Hi!
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
===
 Oh, do you, do you really?
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
===
Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"    means, just don't use it!
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo...
===
Get to the problem!
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
===
 Are you wearing two belts?
 EH, what do you know!
===
You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
===
You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship.
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
===
 Fine.
Thanks.
===
Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
The Metsss!
===
Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Oh, that's what she meant!  You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!
===
with confused angry    baseball fans!
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
===
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love.
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
===
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
too    fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
===
Ok.
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
===
Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right 
===
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
 No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
===
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Phonetically? 
===
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
Ok.
===
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
===
mean?
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
===
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
===
Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't
Come on! you... 
===
Hey!
 You're ready?
===
Yeah, let's go.   Thanks    Ross.
 Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up.
===
Glad I could help man.
Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but...  I made it work.
===
 So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
===
 Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
Oh hey Rach!
===
Yeah...
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
===
I'm sure you have better things to do.
Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
===
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
 Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
===
 Ok, great! All right, bye!  Pain in the ass!!  That's off, right?
What's the matter, Pheebs?
===
Ok, that'll be great!
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
===
That's not what we're gonna do!
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
===
Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
 Alright, have a good time. 
===
Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?
Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
===
We'll see you, guys! 
Bye.
===
 Ok.
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
===
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
===
Yeah.
So, I don't have to learn what that means?
===
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
===
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
===
Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
===
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Oh! How's it going?
===
It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
===
Barbados.
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
===
What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Well, just wake him up!
===
the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
===
Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Then don't go!
===
Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
===
Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Mmh-mmh.
===
 Can you say Barbados?
Barbados!
===
Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
===
 Look at all these paleontologists!!
I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! 
===
Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
 I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
===
Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
That... never happens...
===
 Are you a paleontologist?
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
===
the
 Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
===
I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
===
thong... I meant thong
You really should have been more clear about that!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
 You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
===
going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" 
===
Yeah!
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
===
But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
 Will you wear a thong?
===
I will if you will.
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
===
So you'll be ok?
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
===
Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
No, why?
===
There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! 
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! 
===
Hey! Hey what's going on?
is famous!
===
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in 
===
Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
Hey guys!
===
The chocolates aren't here yet.
Damnit!
===
 Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
teapot?
===
I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
===
Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .
Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
===
Alright, ok, let's do it.  Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? .
===
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
===
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention 
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
===
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
 I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
===
 Kate Miller?
Kate Miller it is. 
===
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
In that case should I make sure it's on real good? 
===
I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
===
Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
===
 No.
There it is, you're blushing!
===
blushing
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? 
===
No.
Tell me who it is.
===
Joey! 
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
===
Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
not get?
===
Oh!  Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
 Yeah, who is that?
===
Do ya?
Yeah.
===
 I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
===
I had a great time.
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
===
So, shall we?
Yeah. 
===
Good night.
Night.
===
What?
He said "erectus"!
===
You're... you're kidding, right?
No, he really said it.
===
Oh, thank you so much!
funny!
===
 Hey! There you are!
ya! 
===
I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
 Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
===
bad
 Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... 
===
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
 Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
===
... is it weird that it's not with each other?
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
===
It's open!  Hi, Joe!
 Hey...
===
 What, is everything ok?
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
===
Nooooo, why?
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
===
 Oh, that's crazy!
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
===
... yeah, it's true.
I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
===
 What, hey!
 Ok, Rach!
===
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like...  What the hell is my problem? OH! 
===
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
 I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
===
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? 
===
You know? Forget it!
 No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
===
I'm talking about! So!
Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
===
 Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
thing!
===
Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts  musings, if you will!
What... for how long?
===
Only like a month!
 A MONTH??
===
us
 I just have one question!
===
Shoot!
 What the hell are you doin'???
===
I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
===
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Yeah, he had a paper route.
===
Yeah, he did!  Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
===
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
 NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
===
But why, why not?
say no!  I couldn't do it to Ross!
===
But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!
===
 I'm sorry, too!  OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
===
It's not a big deal!
NO BIG DEAL!
===
not a big deal!
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
===
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
Yeah. It's actually our first official date 
===
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
===
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear   and self-loathing.
 It's OK!
===
How can you be so confident?
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
===
Really? Like you have a routine?
No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have   to appreciate their uniqueness.
===
Really?
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.   Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
===
You mean like this? 
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. 
===
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. 
More foosball?
===
So.
Yeah.
===
I am sorry, I donât know, I am sorry, I donât   know why I did that!
Okay
===
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I donât   know what happened, I must be nervous!
I donât get it, Chandler loved it!
===
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I wonât   do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
Ok.
===
Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... itâs just a   little weird, itâs you, and itâs me, it's just gonna take some   getting used to.
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
===
Ok, letâs work from the top down!  Just work the bra, Joe!
Ok, yeah, got it.
===
Okay.
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this   thing.
===
Ow!
Sorry!
===
Well this is romantic!
I'm sorry!  This never happened to me   before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can   do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!   I blame your bra!
===
Itâs a standard issue bra clasp!
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me   off with all your slapping!
===
Hey! Got champagne?
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
===
Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone   is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...
Uh!  
===
Ok  Sexy, sexy, very   sexy, sexy.  Alright!   Lets do it!
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
===
Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this!  Ok. Aha! You like   that huh?
Oh! yeah!
===
You like that?  Let's take this into high gear 
uh uh!
===
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
===
What is the matter with us?
Well, I know what's the matter with me.
===
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult?
I don't know.
===
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?
===
Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
===
Right, totally.
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it.
===
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex.
That's a... pla-an.
===
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
===
Yeah.
I love ya.
===
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Yeah, me too.
===
 Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Hey!
===
When they see this you'll be 52!
And starting to think about settling down!
===
Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
===
Joey, it's a birthday party.
Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed    for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as    a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"!     Yeah... that's a funny cup!
===
Thank you!
Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what    would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
===
Oh!
You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one    of her books!
===
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Hey, I think Emma might like it!
===
Oh! Emma might like what?
Um, my present!
===
What did you get her?
Actually we prepared performances.
===
Separate performances.
But equally real!
===
Sure, yeah!
 O K.
===
 Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing    prepared?
Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole    crew waiting!
===
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emmaâs books.
===
Oh, ok, which one?
Uh, why, itâs a...  one of her favorites, uh,     âRiding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum    depressionâ eesh!  âLove    you foreverâ. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly    books. Printed  in Mexico.    A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and    forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang âIâll love    you forever, Iâll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby    youâll beâ. .    And while he rocked her, he sang âIâll love you forever, Iâll    like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youâll beâ.
===
Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even    want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!
I'm so confused!
===
To the bathroom!
Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna    be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
===
 What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! 
Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
===
No, it did not.
No.
===
Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
Ok!  
===
Bye... Bye dear.
Nighty-night!
===
Nighty-night!
Bye, bye.
===
leave?
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he    fought for our country.
===
No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
 Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you    guys in. 
===
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
===
 Joey! It's Estelle!
Hey! 
===
So, how did your audition go today?
 What audition?
===
The one I told you about last week?
What? You never said anything about an audition!
===
 Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition.    I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to    have a monologue prepared.
A monologue? I don't have..  I got it.      Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
===
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever    gets the highest number gets to go first.
===
 Ok, ten.
Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
===
No, lets just draw straws.
Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
===
I'm begging you stop.
Right.
===
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler    and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes    in last, stays!
Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! 
===
Go! Go!
Come on robot!
===
Good job Alan!
Hey, good race you guys.
===
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her    first cookie.
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
===
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from    a can!
===
Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with    the words".
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
===
we were wrong.
I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how    much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
===
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby    adoption decider people..."
===
Hey Phoebe!
Hey!
===
Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
===
Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
That's right, yeah.
===
good!
Always nice to meet a fan!
===
 Oh my God!
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
===
What... what you working on?
 Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it    to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
===
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
What did I just say?
===
 I donât... uh... understand.
 Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya?
===
 It doesnât make any sense.
Of course it does! Itâs smart! I used the the-saurus!
===
word?
Yep!
===
Alright, what was this sentence originally? 
Oh, âThey are warm, nice, people with big heartsâ.
===
And that became âthey are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...?
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
===
Hey Joey, I donât think we can use this.
Why not?
===
Well, Iâm staying with you guys!
What?
===
Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling âMyron, get    off!â
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me weâre    getting rid of her.
===
that!
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"    I donât need that kind of talk in my house!
===
Well Joey, uhm look, I know that sheâs difficult, but I think    itâs really good that sheâs here.
'Cause we will appreciate it more when sheâs gone?
===
No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me.
Yeah, Monica made us!
===
Good morning.
Yeaah.
===
Oh, I canât, honey. Iâm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.  I am not happy.     Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
 IâM CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
===
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
===
You dropped it off?
Yeah.
===
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to    hand-write it. 
===
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Whoo-hoo! 
===
 Joey, where are those bags?
 She has a lot of crap!
===
sweet, and like the   most romantic thing ever.
Well, hey! Well...     Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...     I wanna say Mike?  To Phoebe and Mike!
===
 Hey honey!
 Hi sweetie!
===
Is Monica not here?
No.
===
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for   a big account and they 
Cool!
===
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're    right for the part.
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!    Huh?  I'm old!  I'm tired!     Hey, I'm hot  I'm cold!! Huh??    Come on! What can't I do?
===
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think    you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
I can do that!  "Hello, I'm    your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.    I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
===
Hey you guys.  
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
===
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for    the part.
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor    you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
===
Joe...
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses!
===
Fine!
Thank you. 
===
Work, Joe!
Damn it! 
===
Hey Joe!
What's up?
===
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested.
 Oh.
===
 I'm sorry man.
watched    the tape?
===
 Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.    Stupid 
 You didn't watch the tape.
===
 What!? Of course I did!
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
===
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Well, you lied again! 
===
I watched it!
Keep going Pinocchio!
===
  I did!
 No you didn't! 
===
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
 You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?     
===
O-oh my God!
 What?
===
Joey, what... is... this...
   reasonable price.
===
Joey, we're not keeping this!
But it's an original Buffay...
===
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't    mind that she's haunted. 
Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
===
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body    across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.     And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your    doorknob.
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
===
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And    I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part    or not.
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you    lied.
===
Excellent!
Now, what do you say?
===
Lying is wrong!
And?... AND?
===
Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not    get old.
You're mean!
===
Hey!
What's going on?
===
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
===
And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about    us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very    impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
===
 Little people?
 Celebrity.
===
Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
What's going on?
===
What the hell are you doing?
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
===
Well, we're not.
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
===
We don't have a code word.
We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word    for danger.
===
What?
I forgot my bat.
===
What are you doing here?
 Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
===
I can explain... Joey...
Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back    here. I can't believe you never called me.
===
Excuse me?
Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by    the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
===
I gave you my number, you never called me.
No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do.
===
 Well, I'm pretty sure I gave    you my number.
Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
===
I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...
No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? 
===
Joey, wait!
 NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... 
===
I got a really incredible job offer.
Hey, great! All right!
===
It's in Paris.
What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,    okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid    suburbs...
===
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
===
Of course we can. Congratulations.     Yay!  Joey...
No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
===
 Joey, it would mean so...
Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. 
===
Hey. Everything ok?
Iâm just mad at my agent.
===
Estelle? Why?
Thereâs a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didnât even be put up for it! Sheâd better have a good reason.
===
Iâm guessing she does.
Well  Iâm wanna hear it,    because she keeps doing this.
===
Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her.
Ok. Why?
===
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.    
I love that saying!
===
Itâs a little coincidental, but believable.    . Listen, Iâm sure youâre wondering why    I didnât get you an audition for that TV movie.
Yeah, actually I am!
===
Donât take that tone with me. Who you    think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
No, no, look. All Iâm saying is that youâre my agent, ok?    And youâre not getting me into any auditions and Iâm tired of it.
===
What are you saying?
Iâm saying thatâ¦ . This isn't  working for me    anymore, ok? Estelle, youâre fired. Goodbye. .
===
Hey Joey, want come with me toâ¦ are you ok?
Yeah, I justâ¦ I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be    killing her.
===
No, that wouldnât kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
I donât know. Sheâs got to be taking it hard, I was like    her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And Iâm guessing    he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know sheâs not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. Iâm gonna call her and hire her again.
===
No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call    
Why?
===
Because patience is the road to understanding  which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.
 You blow me away. 
===
 All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her    to call you?
I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. 
===
 Joey,    it's Estelle. 
Estelle?
===
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for    firing me.
 Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
===
Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
No, no, no!  Don't drop by,    don't drop by!
===
Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
===
 It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with    the career. You're gonna be huge.
Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.     "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
