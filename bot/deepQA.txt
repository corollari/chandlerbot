Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today. 
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
===
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off! 
Oh, how well you know me... 
===
 Would anybody like more coffee? 
Did you make it, or are you just serving it? 
===
Absolutely. 
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
===
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
===
Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead. 
===
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
===
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
 Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
===
What? 
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
===
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
...Dinah? 
===
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
===
 I just... can't do it. 
Boys? We're going in. 
===
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.  
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
===
What does she mean by 'involved'? 
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
===
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
What does she do? 
===
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
===
What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
===
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. 
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
===
Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
===
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
Hey, that was really good! 
===
Thanks! Let's keep going. 
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" 
===
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke." 
"Smoke away." 
===
What? 
Relax your hand! 
===
Whoah! 
Hey! 
===
Hey! 
Alright, now try taking a puff. 
===
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. 
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. 
===
Y'miss it? 
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God.  
===
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
Oh, Satan's minions at work again... 
===
What is this?! 
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. 
===
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
And this- is my reward! 
===
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
Okay, so this time I won't quit! 
===
Ohhh! Put it out! 
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.  
===
No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry. 
===
Really! 
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  
===
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 
===
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
I personally could have a gallon of Alan. 
===
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? 
===
It's worse than the thumb! 
Hey, this is so unfair! 
===
Oh, why is it unfair? 
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
===
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
===
 Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. 
Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!  
===
 Hey. Where's Joey? 
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? 
===
 There y'go. 
 Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. 
===
I'm sorry.. 
 Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! 
===
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.  
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
===
No no no! 
 I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! 
===
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
===
No plans, huh?
Not a one.
===
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh, right, right, shut up.
===
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
===
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. 
===
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me 
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
===
 Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
===
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
===
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
===
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearÂyou want it to be dirty?
===
 No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
===
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
===
Ok, have a good break-up.
Hey, Janice.
===
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
===
What?
 What... did you get me there? 
===
I got you...these. 
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
===
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
That's great. 
===
Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
===
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
===
Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
===
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
I'm fine.
===
It's like a gift.
We should always always break up together.
===
 Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
===
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
 Ross, ten o'clock.
===
What?
 There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
===
Oh. Hel-lo!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
===
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
===
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Thank you, buddy.
===
You could do that!
Y'think?
===
Yeah!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
===
C'mon! C'mon!
Here goes. 
===
...Yes?
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.
===
Yes, you said that.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.  
===
 Saw your head. Saw your head.
 She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play, man. Whoah.  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way.  Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. 
===
 No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
===
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
===
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
===
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. 
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
===
Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?
===
Ooooohhh.
Oh, so you're divorced?
===
No.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
===
No, I'm still married.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
===
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
===
What?!
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
===
I suppose mainly sexual.
...Hm.
===
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
===
Tah-daaah!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
===
 I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
===
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
===
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
===
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
===
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
===
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. 
===
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? 
===
Thank you.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
===
 Oh my God, I'm late. 
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. 
===
Okay.
Don't go.
===
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
 Too bad, she's leaving.
===
 I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
===
It's not Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
===
No, it's-it's Andrew. 
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
===
He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
===
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
===
So what do you want?
You.
===
You have me!
Nono, just you.
===
Whaddyou mean?
Lose the other guys.
===
...Like, ...all of them?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
===
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
===
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
===
Which one?
...The second guy.
===
No? What happened, big guy?
 "Big guy?"
===
My mom will.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
===
 Would you like to call somebody? 
Yeah, thanks. 
===
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
===
I have no idea what you just said.
 Put Joey on the phone.
===
 Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen. 
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
===
Would you like some gum?
Um, is it sugarless?
===
My God, you're choking!  That better?
 Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
===
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
OK.
===
Well, this has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
===
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
===
Do you want a date Saturday?
Yes please.
===
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
He's a he?
===
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... 
You did?
===
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
===
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
===
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
===
Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!
===
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
===
Oh! Okay! Phew! 
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
===
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
...Quality, right, great.
===
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
===
What? He's cute!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
===
Is Brian...?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
===
 Morning. We ready to go?
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
===
What?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
===
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. 
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
===
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
===
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
===
...Chandler! 
Hey.
===
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Who are those people?
===
I know. That's what I told her.
Really.
===
Yeah.
So- you can tell?
===
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
===
Hey, hey.
Hey.
===
Hey.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
===
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
===
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
===
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...  
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
===
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Yes, every single one of them.
===
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
I thought it was $98.50.
===
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
===
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
===
Oh, I hate this story.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
===
Oh my god.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
===
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
===
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
===
Chandler, will you just come in already?
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
===
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
===
I can't, I gotta go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
===
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
the keys?
===
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
 For an emergency just like this.
===
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
===
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
===
By all means.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
===
The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
===
And a crappy New Year.
Here, here!
===
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
===
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
===
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
===
Yeah, you wish!
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
===
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
===
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
 That guy's going home with a note!
===
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
===
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
===
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
===
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
===
Nice shoes, huh? 
Aah, y'killing me!
===
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
===
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
===
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
===
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
===
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... 
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
===
Really.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
===
What, uh... what juggling thing?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
===
No.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
===
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! 
You remember Janice.
===
 There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
 But you found me!
===
Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Kill me. Kill me now. 
===
 Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
===
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
===
There y'go, kids.
 And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight. 
===
You seen Sandy?
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
===
 In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
And the moment of joy is upon us.
===
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
===
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
===
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
===
Your mom was arrested?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
===
 ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
===
 ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
===
Awww!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
===
I am famished. What do I want... 
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
===
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
===
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
I know I am.
===
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
===
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. 
===
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
===
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
What?
===
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
 You knew about this?
===
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
===
Thanks, man, big help.
 I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
===
I wasn't- I mean, I-
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you. 
===
I know-
I can't believe you did this. 
===
Me neither, y'know what-
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
===
Chandler-
You gotta let me slam the door! 
===
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? 
===
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare. 
===
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
===
 We're rehearsing a Greek play.
That's very funny. We done now?
===
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
===
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
===
Alright, well, be good, I love you. 
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
===
 O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
===
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Yeah. No. No...
===
You okay, kiddo?
Yeah, okay.
===
Alright. 
Nice save.
===
You mean that?
Yeah, why not.  So I told her.
===
Yeah? How'd it go?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
===
Well, howdya feel?
Pretty good! I told her.
===
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. 
And, we're done with the yogurt. 
===
Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm 
 Mma, Mma, Mmaah
===
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... 
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
===
Need a new table.
You think?
===
That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
===
How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
===
You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
===
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
===
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?
===
Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
===
Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out. 
===
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
===
Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
===
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, don't do that
===
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Fine. 
===
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
More coffee over here, please!
===
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? 
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
===
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? 
That's patio furniture!
===
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
 What about the birds?
===
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You pick one.
===
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
===
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds! 
===
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
===
Come on, two on one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
===
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! 
===
Wha-
What is it?
===
Hey!
Hey!
===

Shut-out!! 
===
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah, get out!
===
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going,  and I'm gone.
 One more game?
===
That is 
I'm sorry!
===
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Rachel, wait, wait.
===
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Can I just say one thing?
===
What? What?!
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
===
Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those. 
===
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Okay.
===
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
===
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
===
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
===
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.
===
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
===
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Huh.
===
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
===
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
 What?  What?
===
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
===
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
===
C'mon up.
 Oh, good. Rog is here.
===
Yeah.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
===
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
===
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
===
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late." 
===
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. 
Well, you're gonna.
===
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
===
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
===
No.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
===
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
===
Thanks, Chandler. 
Get off!
===
I thought it was Chandler!
 What? What?
===
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
===
I dunno, there's just something about...
Basically we just feel that he's...
===
Wow.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
===
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
===
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Any contact?
===
Hey. 
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÂI don't think we need a third... 
===
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
I think it's winning.
===
I think it's insane.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
===
Think it'll work?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
===
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
===
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
===
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
===
 How do I look?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
===
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
...And what did you bring?
===
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
===
Oh.... my.... God.
 Hey, it's Janice.
===
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. 
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
===
 Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
===
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
That's OK.
===
 We can't do that.
 What? What can't you do?
===
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
===
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
===
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
I hope she throws up on you.
===
Just us.
Oh, what a crappy night!
===
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. 
Excuse me.  How ya doin'?
===
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
===
I will go for that drink.
You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
===
Each.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know...
===
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
===
Hi, Monica.
Ok, well, this was very special.
===
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Janice is gonna go away now.
===
 Whoa.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
===
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
===
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, Just Janice.
===
I brought you something.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.
===
That's fine.
 It is?
===
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
===
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Oh, no I don't.
===
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? 
I did, but...
===
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.
===
What is it?
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
===
That's great!
So.... I quit.
===
Why?
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
===
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
===
So was it a lot more money?
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
===
... the WENUS?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
===
So what're you going to do?
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
===
Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
===
Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
===
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
===
Career counselor?
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
===
I don't!
all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
===
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
===
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Who are you going out with?
===
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
speaking metaphorically.
===
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
===
 Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
===
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an 
 Well.... it is amouz-ing...
===
You're not going to believe this!
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
===
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Again?
===
And again, and again, and again...  Hello?  And again.
 Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday! 
===
 Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Look at this! 
===
Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
===
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
 OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
===
 OK.
This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment? 
===
Do you really want a job with 
Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
===
Hey, guys.
Hey.
===
I don't know.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
===
What?
Could you want her more?
===
Shut up!
We're notÂwe're not saying anything.
===
Thank you.
 We were playing poker, alright...
===
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
And then he did.
===
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
===
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
 OK, so at this point, the dealer...
===
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Joey... three... eight. Eight... three.  Alright babe, deal the cards.
===
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
===
Settle what?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
===
Alright boys, let's eat.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
===
You still on that?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
===
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
===
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
===
Chandler?
Couldn't be more out. 
===
Let me see! Show them!
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
===
I'm in for fifty cents. 
Call.
===
Fifteen.
Alright, here's ten. 
===
Thank you.
Good luck.
===
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
: I thought we had them!
===
OK, OK, it's my turn. 
Go.
===
Suck-fest.
Toootal chick-flick.
===
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
They're still just friends, right?
===
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
===
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
===
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
===
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Rachel lost Marcel.
===
Marcel?
Marcel?
===
A monkey.
Yes have you seen any?
===
Just a sec.  Hope you find your monkey. 
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
===
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
===
Marcel?
Marcel?!
===
That's because I'm in front of them.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
===
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
===
Oh, that is so sick.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
===
So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?
===
Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
===
Her answer machine?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
===
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
===
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!
 And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
===
Oh!... Right!
Hey Rach!
===
Why?
I have my reasons.
===
what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Hey, I've been honing!
===
What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
===
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
===
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
===
How many beeps?
She answered.
===
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
===
 Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you?  Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great.  Really?  Oh.  Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and...  Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow!  Okay..  Okay...  Bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
So how's Mindy?
===
Get down?
...And boogie!
===
Why don't you just take it with you?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
===
Why don't you just call her?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
===
Do you?
No!  Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler!  I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone.  Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.  Okay.   She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
===
Don't you have to pee?
'S'why I'm dancing...
===
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Ring dammit, ring!
===
 Hey, you know our phone's not working?
What?!
===
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
 I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
===
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
===
 Chandler?
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
===
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
===
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
...I'm, I'm okay.
===
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
===
You got it.
Okay.
===
Second date!
...I dunno.
===
You 
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
===
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
===
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
===
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Joey... Switzerland?
===
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
===
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
===
 Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Might wanna try Joseph.
===
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
===
 Hi.
Hey.
===
At the vet.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
===
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
So what does this mean?
===
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
===
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
===
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
What?
===
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
===
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
...Take off their hats!
===
a Joseph Stalin?
You're kidding.
===
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
===
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
...He's in.
===
Oh!
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
===
Shut up!
Tell me what?
===
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
 Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
===
Doing it on this table. 
Wow!
===
Why, why, why would you dream that?
More importantly, was I any good?
===
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. 
===
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
===
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Pirates again?
===
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
 Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
===
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story.
===
I could be a secretary.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
===
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
===
He's... our age.
When we were?
===
College?
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
===
 Yeah?
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
===
 Mr. Bing's office.  No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
===
Will he know what this is in reference to?  And he has your number?  All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
What?
===
Ross says hi.
Ah!
===
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
===
Most likely.  Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Okay.
===
All right. Bye bye.
Bye bye.
===
Whatcha doin'?
Ooh. 
===
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me.
===
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Why not?
===
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
What?!
===
I thought you knew that.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
===
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
What are you talking about?
===
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
They do me?
===
 Okay, AndrÃ© should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye.  Just easier that way.
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
===
No, forget it.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
===
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
===
Stegosaurus!
Tyrannosaurus!
===
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Work people? Nobody told me.
===
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
===
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
You think I should?
===
I really do, yeah.
Okay.
===
Okay.
Okay.
===
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
What?
===
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Then, I don't get it.
===
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
They do?
===
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
I just wan't to...
===
No, but you can't.
But I just wa...
===
For the ride.
Yeah, like in a cab...
===
Save it.
Okay, hating this.
===
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
===
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
You have to pick your moments.
===
I want a baby.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
===
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
===
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
You'll get one.
===
Oh yeah? When?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
===
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
===
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
===
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
 Uh, uh.
===
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! 
===
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor? 
===
Yeah, why?
No reason. 
===
Oh, just had a baby.
Mazel tov!
===
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
 You are really frightening me.
===
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
I know, I still am one of these.
===
Pardon?
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. 
===
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
===
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
... And where's this money coming from? 
===
We make fire. Cook meat.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
===
wants to have sex with me.
Crazy bitch.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
===
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
about her.
===
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Course there, they just call it food.
===
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. 
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
===
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
 Ooooh. 
===
Well, thank you, Melanie.
 OK, this one right here is from me.
===
There is a little child inside this man!
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
===
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's. 
===
I can't believe he did this.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
===
What did you just say?
 ahem... um... Crystal duck.
===
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
 F-hah.... flennin....
===
Oh.... my God.
 Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
===
I know. This is really, really huge.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
===
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
===
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. 
 H-He's in China!
===
No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
What about the time difference?
===
From here to the airport?
Yes!  You're never gonna make it!
===
I-I-I don't know.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
===
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. 
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! 
===
Shhhh!
 ...spender.
===
She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?
===
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
===
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
===
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another level.
===
Seven hundred bucks!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
===
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
===
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
===
 Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
===
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
===
Thank you.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
===
Did you talk to him?
Not yet.
===
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
God?
===
It was you, pal.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
===
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
===
Go-go-go-go, come on!   So uh, what did you find out?
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!Â  Without any outside help whatsoever.
===
How is that the silver lining?
You have to really wanna see it.
===
 Hello? Hi.
 Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
===
Needs some clothes altered?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
===
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990?
Okay.Â  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
===
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it.  I gotta get out of here. 
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
===
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
What stupid thing did you do?
===
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
===
 Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
===
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
===
How long do you want the cuffs?
At least as long as I have the pants.
===
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
 Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man!
===
 Hey, what's goin' on? 
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
===
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
===
What?
Cupping.
===
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
===
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
That's ok.
===
I guess so. 
You know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. 
===
 What are you guys doing?
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
===
Carol?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
===
Chandler?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
===
 Hi, honey.
Hey, sweetums.
===
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
===
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. 
What did you just do?
===
What is the big deal? 
What did you just do?
===
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
===
 Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
===
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
 What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
===
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
 All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
===
Yeah I guess you're right.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
===
I'm gonna do it. 
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
===
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Huh. 
===
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
===
 Good morning.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
===
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer. 
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
===
 I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
===
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Nope, not this time.
===
Come on, quite yankin' me.
you.
===
This is Janice.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
===
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
 I'm not breaking up with her! 
===
Wheel!
Of!
===
Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
===
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No, Janice.
===
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
===
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
===
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Well, there you go.
===
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters.
===
Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!
===
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. 
Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
===
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Umm, yeah.
===
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? 
===
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
===
Nooo!
Yeah, okay.
===
Yeah?
Yeah! All right! You go first.
===
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Okay.
===
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
===
Yes! 
I know!
===
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Okay.
===
Okay.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
===
Hmph.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
===
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
===
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
You said...
===
Hey!
What are you guys doing together?
===
Joey and Janice's 
Really.
===
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. 
You still can't stand her can you?
===
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
===
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Well, I guess that's something.
===
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Okay.
===
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Oh God!
===
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Really?
===
 WHOAA!!
 See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
===
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Because the kids need new shoes.
===
Hey.
Do I look fat?
===
Noo.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow. 
===
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
===
And it works both ways.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
===
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
That's easy, baggage claim.
===
 Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
===
Good luck Chandler.
Thank you Rachel.
===
 Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
===
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed...
Yeah. 
===
I'm gonna use the cushion.
Yeah.
===
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
===
Yep.
Okay, one question.
===
Shoot.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
===
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
===
Aww.  Ohh!
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam. 
===
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
===
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
That, that's what's stupid.
===
 Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
You mean there's more than one of us.
===
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
And that's how you bought it?
===
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
===
 Hey.  Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure. What's up?
===
 Are you intrigued?
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
===
Hey.
Hey, man. What's up?
===
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
===
 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Is anybody else scared?
===
 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'  I need a pen. 
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
===
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
 Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
===
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
===
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
===
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Noo.
===
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
===
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
===
Hey, you know about that?!
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! 
===
 Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
===
Amazingly, that makes sense.
You think?
===
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
===
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. 
===
Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
===
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. 
===
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
===
We should?
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
===
 I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
===
You probably want us to move in together?
It doesn't scare me!
===
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!  Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. 
===
Honey, this will help. 
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
===
That is never good.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
===
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
She said she'd call me.
===
Ohh! 
Oh God.
===
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
===
Yeah, you do.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
===
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
===
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
===
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
===
 No, thank you.  Chandler!
 Hello, Janice.
===
What are you doing here?
 Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
===
Are you being British?!
 No. Not anymore.
===
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. 
===
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
===
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
===
Who's party is it?
A woman's
===
What woman?!
 Chelsea.
===
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be? 
Can I be that guy?
===
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
===
Yeah.
Hello!
===
Yes, and grumpy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves!  Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry.  Really?!  Really?!
===
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
 I love you too.
===
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
===
No. Y'know how weÂre always saying we need a place for the mail.
Yeah!
===
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
YouÂre building a post office?
===
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. ItÂs a one day job, max.
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
===
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
===
Her what?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one canÂt get mad.
===
So, Chandler, whoÂs on your list?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
===
Now, you do realize that sheÂs a cartoon, and way out of your league?
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
===
Hardy Boy.
Peter Parker.
===
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, IÂll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
 What a geek!
===
Chandler.
Hi.
===
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
We donÂt, really.
===
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
You know, we donÂt really take advantage of living in the city.
===
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
want this unit!!
===
Well, you shouldÂve told me that before, IÂm not a mind reader. Hey, weÂre out of beer. IÂm going to MonicaÂs.
Fine! 
===
Yeah, itÂs hard okay, I only have two spots left.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
===
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
===
Susan Sarandon.
Eh, y'know what, sheÂs to political, she probably wouldnÂt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
===
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know sheÂs too international, y'know sheÂs never gonna be around.
===
So?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whoÂs gonna be in the country like all the time.
===
Which you just gave up really quickly.
 Have you seen Joey?
===
 Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
WhatÂs going on?
===
HeÂs retiling my floor. 
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
===
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
He started mine first!
===
ItÂs beautiful! ItÂs like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?
What, like a number?
===
 Hey! 
Hi! Bye! 
===
Why donÂt we just go on two.
Why two?
===
Because itÂs faster.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ÂtwoÂ talk.
===
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Okay, one...two...
===
All right!! 
Oh, good job Joe.
===
Wow, itÂs big!
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! 
===
Look itÂs not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how Âbout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? 
===
Y'know what?
Umm?
===
I bet Âya ya I could fit in there. 
IÂve got five bucks says you canÂt.
===
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
===
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Yeah, you got me.  IÂm out five big ones!  Here you go.
===
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
 Hey.
===
Hey.
IÂm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
===
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who IÂm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ÂChandler Bing,Â he said ÂWhoa-whoa, short message.Â
===
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Umm, howÂs it going with you guys?
===
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thatÂs cool.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
===
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisterÂs beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, sheÂs a porn star. 
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youÂre chances are pretty good.  All right. 
===
DonÂt you ah, donÂt you wanna ask me any questions?
Sure. Ummm. WhatÂs up?
===
Well, ah, IÂm an actor. IÂm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and donÂt worry IÂm totally okay with the gay thing.
What gay thing?
===
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Do I ever.
===
Chris says theyÂre closing down the bar.
No way!
===
Yeah, apparently theyÂre turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
===
Got me.
 Can I get a beer.
===
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
You betcha!
===
Is it the Italian guy?
Um-mm, yeah right!
===
HeÂs so cute.
Oh yes, and thatÂs what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
===
Oh look, the pool tableÂs free. Rack Âem up. IÂll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay, but after that, weÂre shootinÂ some pool.
===
Yeah, so?
 And now IÂve picked it up again. 
===
Hey! 
 Hey!
===
Thank you soo, much.
Oh, donÂt thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
===

WhatÂs it about?
===
Lifeguards.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  WhoÂs she?
===
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Yeah, IÂll go get one.
===
Hey.
Do you have any beers? WeÂre out of beers.
===
 Help yourself.
You okay?
===
Phoebe moved out.
Right.
===
I donÂt understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I donÂt have a boyfriend?
Noo!! You donÂt have a boyfriend because....I donÂt, I donÂt know why you donÂt have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
===
Well, I think so.
Oh-ho, come here.  Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman IÂve ever known in real life.
===
I know, it is isnÂt it?
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
===
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
===
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Oh yeah, that sounds great.  Oh, and listen, itÂs, itÂs gonna be....
===
Cool!!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. 
===
Booo!!
 DonÂt look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
===
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do.  All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, IÂll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
 IÂll go.
===
Yay!!
See, thatÂs why I could never be an actor. Because I canÂt say gig.
===
Did you make brownies today?
Knock, knock.
===
 Quick, take off your dress, he wonÂt notice the bed.
Hey, IÂm going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
===
ItÂs MonicaÂs bed. What?
Okay.  ItÂs a racecar.
===
So. This has always been MonicaÂs bed, what youÂre just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Okay, well it this bed isnÂt new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
===
Well, I-I mightÂve said supergay.
You totally screwed him over.
===
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 
I will have one. 
===
No, no, itÂs just my tooth.
All right IÂll have one. 
===
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I canÂt see him.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
===
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienistÂs blouse.
===
IÂd really prefer a mountain bike.
JaniceÂs birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
===
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
ThatÂs a good idea, ÂDear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthdayÂ. I would like to get her something serious.
===
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
All right. Look, IÂm gonna go in here, and you donÂt buy me anything ever. 
===
 No, no, you canÂt, you canÂt, okay, you canÂt, you canÂt buy her pearls, you just canÂt, you canÂt, you canÂt.
Why not?!
===
Oh God. Uh, okay, hereÂs the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
What is the thing?
===
Okay. I went down to the ÂMattress KingÂ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
 What?
===
They were in his office.
Well she, she wouldnÂt do that, sheÂs with, sheÂs with me.
===
IÂm telling you man, I saw it.
Yeah, well, youÂre wrong! Okay, youÂre wrong.
===
 HowÂs my Bing-a-ling?
Ah, I donÂt know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
===
Why are your eyes so white?
You tell me! Maybe, itÂs because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
===
Oh my God!!
All right!
===
How did you know?
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
===
In the park?
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
===
Just those two!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
===
Oh, IÂm sorry honey, IÂm so, so,  haaaaa! IÂm so, so sorry, I just  haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I canÂt breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
 Here.
===
The receipt.
IÂll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me?  Are you finished with him?  Do you still love him?  Do you still love me?  All right look,  IÂm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? 
===
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Yeah.
===
Well, now we got a reason.
What?
===
Well, weÂre fashioning a very long poking device.
All right.
===
Hey uh, whatÂs a matter?
I talked to Janice.
===
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
She doesnÂt know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I canÂt even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
===
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
I donÂt know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
===
Well, it doesnÂt matter what I would do.
Come on, tell me.
===
All right, youÂre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out.
What?  What are you, what are you talking about?
===
Okay.
I think you should go back with Gary. I donÂt wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ÂYouÂre the reason, you are the reason why their not together.Â and I hated that guy. And it didnÂt matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
===
Wow!
Yeah, well. ItÂs the right thing to do.
===
Oh! YouÂre right. Oh God. But, before I can say Âgood-byeÂ, thereÂs something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, itÂs like, I finally understand what Lionel RichieÂs been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, itÂs like movie love, youÂre my soulmate, and I canÂt believe weÂre not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Then donÂt leave me!
===
What?
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
===
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-IÂve got to give my marriage another chance.
No you donÂt! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
===
 IÂm sorry. 
Ohhh. DonÂt go.
===
No, I-I-I gotta go. 
No. No! No! No!
===
Honey, honey, people are looking.
I donÂt care!  I donÂt care!!
===
Yeah, um, IÂm, IÂm leaving now. 
You canÂt leave! I have your shoe!
===
Great, you can cover Chandler.
No, no, no, I donÂt, I donÂt really wanna play.
===
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
ThatÂs not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. DonÂt say that I donÂt have goals!
===
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe itÂll take your mind off Janice, and if you donÂt play, everyone will be mad at you Âcause the teams wonÂt be even. Come on.
Yeah, all right, IÂll play.
===
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ÂGeller Bowl.Â
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
===
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, Ânobody won that game, Â and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.
And was the curse lifted?
===
All right, weÂre gonna play.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom wonÂt let me cross the street.
===
All right, we have to pick captains.
And then Tineals.
===
Well, why donÂt we just bunny up.
What?
===
All right people listen, IÂve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
===
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Sorry. IÂm sorry. Y'know what, weÂre just gonna throw it.
===
Yeah, losers talk!
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
===
Yeah!
 Hike!
===
 I almost caught that one!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
===
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
No, no, no, no, no!
===
IÂm sorry Dutch, I didnÂt get that last little bit.
 Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna..  Hi, IÂm Chandler.
===
Mar-gha.
Mar-haaaan.
===
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Yeah! Why donÂt you stick around. You can sit right there.
===
I think so.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
===
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
===
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, IÂll let you have her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didnÂt I wouldnÂt have a shot?
===
Well I donÂt like to say it out loud, but, yeah! DonÂt feel bad man, we all have our strengths. YouÂre better with numbers and stuff.
Math!! YouÂre giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, weÂll see who gets her.
===
What the hellÂs the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
===
All right, thatÂs it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Hey! Well, IÂve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you thatÂs mean!
===
After!!
Before!!
===
The Geller Cup.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
===
Yeah.
Okay, good.
===
 The game is over, we eat now?
No-no-no-no, the gameÂs not over, weÂre just switching teams.
===
Right. Okay, letÂs play. LetÂs go.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
===
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
===
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-IÂm not playing with this guy, now.
Fine with me.
===
Okay, y'know what, letÂs just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 
===
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Yes!!
===
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didnÂt understand the question.
Well, you donÂt you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
===
IÂm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister IÂll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! 
===
IÂm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Wh-what?
===
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
WeÂre not gonna lose to girls.
===
 Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
===
 I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so youÂre five feet short, so we win!
===
Let go! IÂm a tiny little woman!!
Guys! Guys! Come on! ItÂs Thanksgiving, itÂs not important who wins or loses. The important thing is,  the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
===
IsnÂt there a national football league.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
===
What?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
===
 Eh, do you believe that?
 Yeah?
===
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
===
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
===
All right, see you guys. 
Look out kids, heÂs coming! 
===
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, IÂm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, IÂm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
===
Well, yeah! IÂm still pursuing that.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
===
The fear?
HeÂs right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
===
Gunther, I quit.
 Does this mean weÂre gonna have to start paying for coffee? 
===
....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?
I spelled out boobies.
===
 Oh God! 
So, how many have you sold so far?
===
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh my God, how did you do that?
===
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Me! On my computer.
===
Well you sure used a large font.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
===
Hey-hey-hey thatÂs funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Something else I might have said?
===
No, itÂs not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I donÂt have a lead. Okay, y'know what, IÂm just gonna, IÂm just gonna call Gunther and IÂm gonna tell him, IÂm not quitting.
You-you-you donÂt wanna give into the fear.
===
 Hey! I got great news!
Run, Joey! Run for your life! 
===
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
 Hey! HowÂd the interview go?
===
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
===
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, youÂre the best!
ItÂs like ÂNight of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.Â
===
 Hello?  Yeah, this is she.  Oh! YouÂre kidding! YouÂre kidding!  Oh thank you! I love you!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
===
Here we go. IÂm serving my last cup of coffee.  There you go.  Enjoy. 
 Should I tell her I ordered tea?
===
Honey, whatÂs the matter?
I just saw Janice. 
===
Oh.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kidÂs pretzel at them.
===
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
===
Hey Chandler, thereÂs a party tomorrow, youÂll feel better then.
Oh, y'know what, IÂm gonna be okay, you donÂt have to throw a party for me.
===
ItÂs JoeyÂs birthday.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
===
Chandler!
Hello-dillillio!!
===
 Stick out your tongue.
 Take off your shirt!
===
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
just like Mom used to make.
===
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
 Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
===
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are JoeyÂs sisters.
Hi JoeyÂs sisters!
===
 What Âcha doing?
Oh, IÂm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
===
Oh!!
No-no-no-no, no, itÂs a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why canÂt we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.
===
How ya feelinÂ?
Well, my apartment isnÂt there anymore, because I drank it.
===
Yeah.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
===
Woooo hoooo!!!
Ow, no Âwoo-hooing,Â no Âwoo-hooing.Â 
===
Why, what happened?
Ah, I fooled around with JoeyÂs sister.  Well, thatÂs not the worst part. 
===
What is the worse part?
I canÂt remember which sister.
===
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, heÂs actually going to kill you dead.
Okay! You donÂt think I thought of that?
===
No, no, no, thatÂs Dina.
 You see you canÂt tell which one is which either, dwha!!
===
We didnÂt fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Veronica. Look, itÂs got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
===
That was me.
Look, when IÂve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and IÂm sorry.
===
Come on!! 
Why canÂt we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
===
Really? ThatÂs great! You and my sister, sittinÂ in a tree.
Yep, IÂm in a tree.
===
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. HowÂs it going. This is the hardest letter IÂve ever had to write.  What the hellÂs a matter with you? How do you think JoeyÂs going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Well, thatÂs the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually IÂll be in Cuba.
===
All right, look, look, youÂve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
===
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
IÂm here to see Mary-Angela.
===
You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, Âcause my Grandma doesnÂt know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
WhereÂs Mary-Angela?
===
No! I did!
Well, itÂs, itÂs yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
===
Of course! ItÂs her favorite.
So um, Mary-Angela, whatÂs your second favorite?
===
More of GrandmaÂs teramisu.
Would you just please....give me the receipt Âcause this is great. ItÂs top notch.
===
That dies with me.
So will I.
===
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnÂt mean anything.
===
 Just do it.
Will you excuse me I have to um..... 
===
Finally, I thought weÂd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. 
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.  Um, I just got out of a relationship and IÂm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
===
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Ahhhh, youÂre not Mary-Angela.
===
No, IÂm Mary-Theresa.
This is so bad. If-if youÂre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
===
 I am!
Oh, this is soo bad. 
===
Joey!!!
No Joey! No Joey! DonÂt Joey! Joey!
===
WhatÂs goinÂ on?
 YouÂre it! Now run and hide!
===
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
I wasnÂt sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, IÂm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
===
Yeah! Punch him!!
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brotherÂs not going to punch me.  Are ya?
===
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought youÂd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youÂre my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
===
No you wonÂt. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, heÂs sorry. But,  youÂve got one more apology to make, all right, youÂve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Okay, absolutely!
===
All right.
YouÂve got it. 
===
Cookie, now you can punch him!
What?! 
===
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
DonÂt worry.
===
 Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes? 
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress. 
===
 It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her! 
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday? 
===
Why? 
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist. 
===
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. 
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? 
===
 Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses! 
 It must take you forever to find your keys. 
===
Oh. 
 Hey, so can you make it on Friday? 
===
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? 
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper. 
===
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clichÃ©. Why don't you get a magician?! 
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right. 
===
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  he's really good looking.  What am I gonna do? 
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud. 
===
 Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical? 
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. 
===
Who? 
I'll get you the Cliff Notes. 
===
The what? 
The abridgment. 
===
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.  
Oh no, no, no, no. 
===
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. 
===
 The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
To yourself.  Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. 
===
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. 
Bye-bye. 
===
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! 
What, what, what?! 
===
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! 
You really think that is what he meant? 
===
Why?! How?! How is he a genius? 
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. 
===
What am I going to do? 
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits. 
===
I don't know you guys. 
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' 
===
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' 
He paints quite a picture doesn't he? 
===
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? 
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got.  See, she's fully dressed, right? 
===
Right. 
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!  
===
Hello. 
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. 
===
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn? 
===
You have a play date with a stripper?! 
Man, I gotta get a kid.  
===
 Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. 
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper. 
===
What are you doing?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
===
Monica, what are you doing?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now sheÂs celebrating that by going on a date with him.
===
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Oh, hey.
===
Oh.
 So ah, isnÂt a bit cold out for shorts?
===
Well, IÂm from California.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
===
Yeah, make that three.
Okay Ross, why donÂt you come with me?
===
Okay.   What ah, what is the matter with you? WhatÂs going on?
RobertÂs coming out.
===
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
No. He.....heÂs coming out of his shorts.
===
What?!
The man is showing brain.
===
No, no, that wonÂt be ah, that wonÂt be necessary  
 Wellll?
===
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What do we do? What do we do?
===
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Like an eclipse.
===
These little women. Wow!
Your liking it, huh?
===
Hey!
Hey.
===
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
You mean a three pointer?
===
You guys!! Come on!
IÂm sorry, IÂm sorry, it just seems that Robert isnÂt as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
===
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
===
All right IÂll talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Hmmm, thatÂs very cool.
===
Joey! I canÂt believe you just did that!
I canÂt believe she cracked your code!
===
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
No, Beth doesnÂt die, she doesnÂt die. Does she Rachel?
===
Please, right now, no, every time I see him itÂs like ÂIs it on the lose?Â ÂIs it watching me?Â
We canÂt tell him, you canÂt go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
===
 Hey, donÂt we have to...
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
===
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
I like her.
===
 Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Well, thatÂs pretty much all IÂm looking for from these people.
===
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
 All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. IÂd like know whether thatÂs several big fish or just one big fish.
===
 Someone in there?
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called Âwait until the last moment before I burst and die.Â
===
Ginger.
Ginger. IÂm talking to Ginger, so.... 
===
DonÂt you have to use the bathroom?
Nope, nope, IÂd just ah, IÂd rather talk to you.  Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. 
===
Actually, me too.
 Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
===
Oh damn, I hate that.
Yeah, weÂre gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
===
Oh, donÂt worry about it.
No, really youÂre gonna freeze.
===
No, IÂm not.
YouÂre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
===
 Hi!
Hey.
===
Oh, can I borrow this?  My milkÂs gone bad.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
===
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Great. It was great. SheÂs ah, sheÂs great, great looking, great personality, sheÂs greatness.
===
Sounds like sheÂs got the ah, whole package.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
===
Uh-huh.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnÂt have, but it did. I mean I like her, I donÂt want to stop seeing her, but every so often itÂs like ÂHey, y'know what, whereÂs your leg?Â I mean IÂm the smallest person in the world arenÂt I? IÂm the smallest person in the world.
===
 Morning.
 Actually heÂs the smallest person in the world.
===
 Heard about the leg burninÂ huh?
It came up.
===
Your thinking about my leg arenÂt you?
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
===
ItÂs okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: ÂHow much it bothers you?Â because I donÂt like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
No. No. I donÂt think so.
===
WhatÂs that?
ThatÂs-thatÂs my nubbin.
===
WhatÂs a nubbin?
ItÂs kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
===
You have three nipples?
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...  Ahh, what?
===
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
===
Where have you been?
The doctor.
===
Is everything okay?
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
===
Oh, no thanks.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
===
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Yeah! You wanna come?
===
 Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
===
Chloe, switch with me, thereÂs some guys here that got a crush on you.
 Okay, that hurt us.
===
Hi guys. I havenÂt seen you since this morning.
Well ah, ........y'know.
===
Great. IÂll ah, see ya then.
All right, rock on. 
===
Uh, 10:30.
What time is it now?
===
4:30.
Yeah all right, so weÂll hang out.
===
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Yes. Vividly.
===
She was kidding about that right?
Yeah, I-I-I think so.  Yeah, I-I think so...
===
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
===
Dude, I donÂt know.
She was kidding.
===
Yeah.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
===
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you donÂt want to be doing something and then look up and see something you donÂt want to be seeing.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... 
===
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  y'know each would,  y'know  be?
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
===
Yeah, I guess, but whatÂs like heads and whatÂs tails?
Well it you donÂt know that, then I donÂt want to do this with you.
===
I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we donÂt do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ÂletÂs Ross it!Â
And thatÂs the only colour that comes in.
===
Oh! 
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
===
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
===
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, donÂt I have to wait a while?
Hey, this isnÂt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
===
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
===
You think?! God, I, ah, IÂm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? RachelÂs all like, ÂI love you and, and letÂs work on this.Â And all I can think about is, ÂWhat is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?Â when I tell her what I did.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
===
Look, Ross look, IÂm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thatÂs gonna get you in trouble.
HeÂs right. NobodyÂs gonna benefit, and youÂre just gonna hurt her.
===
Yeah, but donÂt you think....
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timingÂs right. And thatÂs what deathbeds are for.
===
Oh, I-I donÂt think thereÂs any trail.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. IssacÂs sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And PhoebeÂs friends with Rachel. And thatÂs the trail, I did it!
===
We were just waxing our legs.
Off?!!
===
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Yeah, well I donÂt think you can make that statement, unless youÂve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
===
Oh yeah, come here. 
Oh, thatÂs mature.
===
What?
Nothing, nothing.
===
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
===
Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didnÂt tell us?!
 He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
===
Awful! Horrible!
She was not good. Not good.
===
Ewwwww!
Uh-oh.
===
Should we do something?
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
===
We could eat the wax! ItÂs organic.
Oh great, food with hair on it.
===
No, not the used wax.
would be crazy?
===
TheyÂre gonna get through this, arenÂt they?
Yeah, come on, itÂs Ross and Rachel, theyÂve got too.
===
You think I need a new walk?
What?
===
Well y'know, IÂve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a Âtake noticeÂ walk.
Are you actually saying these words?
===
Maybe she killed him?
LetÂs go.
===
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
We are. HeÂs meeting us here.
===
Well Ross was hanginÂ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
===
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Y'know what maybe itÂs gonna be okay, I mean itÂs been a week.
===
 Is he here?
No.
===
Hm-mm.
Yeah, heÂs really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
===
Chandler!!
 Oh my God!
===
YouÂre smoking again?!
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, IÂm, IÂm smoking still.
===
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Look, IÂm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
===
WerenÂt you nine?!
Yeahhh. IÂm tellinÂ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
===
Him? Him, Ross?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. 
===
Chandler! YouÂre smoking? What are you doing?!
Hey, shut up!! YouÂre not my real Mom!!
===
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. ItÂs been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
===
Pity food? Y'know what thatÂs okay, all right, I donÂt need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
===
Why? Do you think heÂs still mad at us?
 Well heÂs probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
===
Chandler!!
What?
===
What does the sign say?
Beam me up Jesus.
===
No, the ÂNo SmokingÂ sign. ThereÂs no smoking in my GrandmotherÂs cab.
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
===
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Oh, come on, thereÂs a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
===
No, y'know what donÂt close it  Âcause the... keys...are in there.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
===
WhatÂs going on?
 My lighterÂs in there! 
===
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
===
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Ladies, ladies, letÂs just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off MonicaÂs bra.
===
 Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
===
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Okay, now letÂs decide who has the nicest ass.
===
Chandler!!
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
===
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old. 
===
Then why are you smoking?
Well itÂs very unsettling.
===
Oh, itÂs Ross on one of his drives!
Hey!!
===
Arrrghh!!
Oh no, now itÂs not gonna make any sense!
===
 You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and weÂre then gonna go skiing?
Oh, this is horrible, itÂs just horrible.
===
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
No, I wasnÂt gonna ask you that, no.
===
Excuse me?
ItÂs horrible.
===
I-I canÂt handle this, you guys.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handleÂs my middle name. Actually itÂs the ah, middle part of my first name.
===
 Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Guys, guys, guess who I am?! 
===
 Oh, no-no, no-no-no, thereÂs none of that in here.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
===
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Okay.
===
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. 
No-no, why donÂt you hang on to that one.
===
Well, IÂm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. 
Oh.  Nope, that patch is no good. 
===
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
===
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck.  IÂm gonna, IÂm gonna get my ah, my fiancÃ©e man!
Y'know, I wouldÂve bet good money that heÂd be the first one of us to get married.
===
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Always illegal Joe.
===
Ohhh.

===
All right.

===
Here you go.
Thanks
===
Hey Mon, letÂs give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
What check thing?
===
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so IÂd call him.
 Pete Becker. PeteÂ   Is this him?
===
ThatÂs Bill Clinton.
WhoÂs he hugginÂ?
===
Oh my God! ThatÂs Pete! But why is Bill hugginÂ Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
===
We use it!!
There you go!!
===
Oh my God! The millionaireÂs here!
 Oh my God! 
===
Guys, please, IÂm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
===
I know!!
Okay, then get the lobster!
===
Hey, howÂd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
===
Two.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
===
Oh.
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
===
 Hello.
Hey!
===
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
ItÂs possible. You are very loveable, IÂd miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.
===
Then be supportive like a guy.
 If I broke up with you, IÂd miss you.
===
So, youÂre like a zillionaire? 
And youÂre our age. YouÂre our age.
===
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
ThatÂs not a state Joe.
===
Okay.
YouÂre our age!
===
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, sheÂd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didnÂt just break up.
===
Hey, itÂs been like three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
===
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, IÂm gonna kill myself, I swear. I canÂt, I canÂt watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, sheÂs going in.
Okay.
===
SheÂs going in. Wait! HeÂs going in! HeÂs going in!! The doorÂs closed! I, I canÂt see anything but the door closed!!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
===
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Stop what?!
===
I need juice! People need juice!!
Look man!
===
People need juice!
Listen to me!!  
===
Yeah, okay. 
Okay. 
===
ItÂs just I miss her so much.
I know.  
===
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks sheÂs like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
===
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ÂOh, IÂm so talented.Â and ÂOh, IÂm so pretty,Â and ÂOoh, I smell so good.Â
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
===
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
IÂm talking about you. You big, big freak.
===
Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, youÂre out of your mind.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youÂd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
===
 Hey!  Why isnÂt it Spiderman? YÂknow like Goldman, Silverman...
ÂCause itÂs-itÂs not his last name.
===
It isnÂt?
No, itÂs not like, like Phil Spiderman. HeÂs a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but thereÂs no Gold Man.
===
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
What about things that are already gold?
===
Ahh, his work is done.
Okay, letÂs play my game now.
===
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
===
Hey, Rach!
Hey.
===
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didnÂt have to walk me all the way back up here.
Oh, thatÂs-thatÂs okay, no problem. 
===
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we donÂt keep the womenÂs lingerie here in the office?
Yes, I realise that.
===
Summer catalogue! 
ThatÂs the stuff! 
===
Bing! ThatÂs a great name.
Thanks, itÂs ah, Gaelic, for ÂThy turkeyÂs done.Â So ah, IÂm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
===
 Hey!
Hello.
===
Well, maybe itÂs so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
 And is this in case the house sneezes?
===
I-I know. Well if something comes up... 
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
===
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? CheckinÂ out the Chan-Chan man!
===
 That was  surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. IÂll do it.
===
Ahhhh!!
 Hey, my FatherÂs house does that!
===
 O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and thereÂs nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening. 
===
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming Âcause, Âcause her eyes keep going like this. 
 IÂm telling ya, JoannaÂs got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ÂThis was fun. LetÂs do it again sometime. IÂll give you a call.Â
===
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks youÂre going to call her?
ThatÂs what you say at the end of a date.
===
You canÂt just say, ÂNice to meet you, good night?Â
To her face? Look itÂs the end of the date, IÂm standing there, I know all sheÂs waiting for is for me to say ÂIÂll call herÂ and itÂs just y'know, comes out. I canÂt help it, itÂs a compulsion.
===
 Call her! Call her now!
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
===
Why hasnÂt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I donÂt understand. Why? He said heÂll call. Why? Why? Chandler IÂm telling you she has flipped out, sheÂs gone crazy!
 Oh, well give me the phone then.
===
Come on, this isnÂt funny. She thinks itÂs my fault that you havenÂt called her. You have to call her!
Look, you canÂt call somebody after this long just to say, ÂIn case you didnÂt notice, I donÂt like you!Â
===
Well then youÂre going to have to take her out again.
Nooo!! SheÂs really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
===
I donÂt care! I donÂt care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows itÂs actually ended. And, I donÂt care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
All right! Fine! But itÂs just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I donÂt want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
===
ThatÂs fine!
ThatÂs just a lot of big talk, y'know.
===
Well, thanks again for lunch.
 Yes, this, this was pleasant.
===
It was, wasnÂt it?
The food there was, was great.
===
WasnÂt it?
So take care.
===
You too.
Well, this was great. IÂll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.  
===
 Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Noo! 
===
Chandler!!
Look, IÂm sorry. Okay? IÂm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
===
Okay, you are going to tell her and youÂre going to tell her now. 
AhhhhÂIÂm not going to call you.
===
What?
IÂm sorry. IÂm-IÂm-IÂm sorry that I said I was going to when IÂm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnÂt RachelÂs fault. ItÂs me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. And IÂm really sorry, itÂs just that this is not, this isnÂt going to work out.
===
Well, this isnÂt how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Yeah, o-okay.
===
So...
Well this is great! IÂll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
===
 Hey!
Hey.
===
 IÂm gonna be on TV!!
No way!
===
Yeah! TheyÂre putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and 
Oh my God! WhoÂs gonna watch that?!
===
Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah. 
===
Saw a girl with that vest.
Thanks. 
===
Umm, oh, about three months.
Okay, so I guess thatÂs about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
===
 Hey!!
Hey!
===
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Okay.  ItÂs a chicken.
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
===
Oh, well no problem there. 
Easy Lenny.
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
HowÂs she doing?
She?
===
Well yeah, donÂt-donÂt you think itÂs a she?
I donÂt know.  I canÂt tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
===
Well, anyway, I got to go change, IÂm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?
===
What?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
===
Hey! Who was up from 2 oÂclock this morning until 5 oÂclock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
You donÂt think I get up when you get up?
===
Ohhh, here it comes.
Yes, here it comes! IÂm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I donÂt think so mister!
===
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
And you donÂt think taking care of our chick is work?
===
ThatÂs not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, weÂve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
===
I donÂt know, maybe we werenÂt ready to have a chick.
IÂll take her back tomorrow.
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
 Sure. IÂll help you.
 Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
Okay, good, good, good, Âcause, good, Âcause I was kinda having second thoughts too. 
Okay. And itÂs not just chicks y'know? ItÂs all kinds of other animals!
===
ThatÂs horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Thanks, IÂm glad you see it that way.
===
 ThatÂs a duck.
ThatÂs a bad duck!!!  HowÂd the thing go tonight, Ross?
===
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
 Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy! 
===
What Âcha doing?
Having a swim.
===
What about the chick?
Chicks donÂt swim.
===
Are you sure?
I donÂt know. Should we try it?
===
 Wait. Give him a minute.
Noo!  Oh, itÂs okay, itÂs okay, baby, baby, baby.
===
No! Rachel, thatÂs what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I donÂt get through, theyÂre not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! ItÂs us versus them!
Ye-e-es!!
===
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
I had one.
===
Really? WhoÂs number two?
WhoÂs number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
===
Okay, bye-bye!
Bye!
===
Joey, what are you doing?! ItÂs never gonna happen, sheÂs seeing somebody.
Yeah, and I donÂt have any cologne.
===
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
===
Yes!! Yes!! IÂm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
 Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre? 
===
No.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
===
So, so, whatÂd ya think?
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
===
I-I wasnÂt in that.
I know.
===
 Excuse me. Excuse me.  Sweetheart!  Come! 
So thatÂs the girl you like.
===
 IÂm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think heÂs baaad news!
like the guy RachelÂs dating? Well, thatÂs odd.
===
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face  and her chest  I could really put something together.
Could I borrow it?
===
 This is from the woman at the bar.
Oh-ho-ho-ho. 
===
One.
7:15.  Watch doesnÂt work.
===
No, itÂs not just Âcause IÂm jealous.  I mean IÂm not, IÂm not, IÂm not jealous, okay? ItÂsÂ Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together!
===
WeÂre kidding!
Ross, donÂt. Ross!
===
Ooh, I donÂt know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Ohh, thatÂs a good one.
===
Oh, IÂ 
Why donÂt you use ours across the hall, Âcause sheÂhasÂproblems.
===
Sorry, IÂm so sorry, I will pay you back.
And yet, sheÂs still not hanging up the phone.
===
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Or... Dick.
===
 Hey.
Hey.
===
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
===
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. 
Whoa!!!
===
Come on you guys, it's no big deal! 
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh.
===
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see aÂ 
===
 Hey guys! What's... 
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
===
Hi!
Hey!
===
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred. 
===
 Fire safety is not a joke, son.
You're right, I know.
===
 Well?!
 Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
===
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
===
 I gotta go water Pete's plants.  Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I 
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
===
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
===
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do 
 I-kea! This is comfortable.
===
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
===
Would you stop? WeÂve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we donÂt even know if heÂs gonna propose.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? HeÂs not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thatÂs like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
===
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Oh, so youÂre going with the teacher, huh?
===
So thanks for the warm welcome. ItÂs good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, letÂs go out there and get Âem! Huh? And remember, there is no ÂIÂ in team.
to my office.
===
 You! Chuckles! WhatÂs your name?
Oh itÂs Bing, sir. IÂm sorry , I was just ah...
===
Yes!!
All right buddy, way to go! 
===
 Dude, what are you doing?
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
===
Yeesh, whatÂd you do about it?
Well, I didnÂt do anything. I didnÂt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
===
Y'know I donÂt, I donÂt understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbinÂ her boob.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between Âem.
===
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
 What if Joey were president?
===
Bing!  Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun.  Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on.  Wham!  Good one. That was a good one.  Keep at it team. 
 What is with him?
===
We never get smacked.
Well, thatÂs not true, he-he smacked you once.
===
 Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
No sir.
===
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
 Hey! Which oneÂs my turkey burger?
===
Okay, weÂll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, itÂs gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow IÂm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
===
 Bing! You got those numbers for me?
No, I ah, I didnÂt do them.
===
Oh, you forgot?
No, no I just ah, didnÂt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly donÂt deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
===
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  ThatÂs okay, youÂre still my number one guy!  Bing!
Doug!!
===
Hmm.
IÂm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
===
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
No, no. It-itÂs not about the swearing, itÂs more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
===
Oh?
Oh, and donÂt get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. ItÂs just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, itÂs making all the other guys jealous.
===
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! YouÂre okay.
Okay. 
===
Ha!  Ahhhhhhh!
Ahhhhh! 
===
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so IÂm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30.  Phil! Nice job.  Stevens! Way to go!  Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya!   Bing! Good job, couldnÂt have done it without ya. 
Thank you, sir.
===
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard!   Well, what about you? YouÂre not feeling left out or anything are ya?
No. No, not at all, thatÂs-thatÂs ridiculous.
===
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. DonÂt you?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
===
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, heÂs just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
===
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I donÂt know, we were, we were making out.
Tell it again.  Seriously.
===
 Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!  ThatÂs my MomÂs writing! Look.
 Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
===
 Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
YouÂre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
===
 Thanks!
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, IÂll be your boyfriend.
===
Yeah right.
Why is that so funny?
===
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
===
Well, no. YouÂre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! 
Okay, so weÂve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werenÂt friends, say itÂs a blind date. I show up at your door, and IÂm like  ÂHey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.Â
===
 Hey! 
Hey!
===
Ohh, thank you.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
===
Oh, come on!
Big bullies!!
===
 Oh, hey!
Hey!
===
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Bored and bored!
===
Ohh!!
Yes!
===
Okay.  Ooh, y'know we could just do this. 
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
===
Huh?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
===
You didnÂt even take off your pants.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
===
What?
I donÂt know.
===
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnÂt up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Oh, yeah, I donÂt know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
===
Yeah, well, donÂt ÂAww Pheebs, that sucks!Â me yet. 
Where ya going?
===
Well! Good night.  IÂm going upstairs.
GÂnight.
===
ThatÂs not true! Her, she doesnÂt even know what she wants! RachelÂs still mad about the whole thing.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You donÂt need that kindÂve hurt. Take it from a guy whoÂs never had a long term relationship......
===
 Hey!
Ahhhh! 
===
You guys, the waterÂs great. You should really go in.
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
===
Okey-dokey!
hair on that head.
===
ThatÂs that weird voice again.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youÂre gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
===
 Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnÂt go out with a guy like Chandler...
  Hi there. 
===
 Shoot! WeÂre out of soda.
 Oh, IÂll go out and get you some.
===
Really?!
Nope! Because IÂm not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
===
Ennnh.
IÂve got canned goods.
===
 Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.
===
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
===
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
WeÂve got to do something!
===
DonÂt blame me, I saw it on 
Y'know what, heÂs right. ThereÂs something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
===
Nothing. IÂm gonna take a shower.
Me too!!
===
to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her!   WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
gonna break up with you!
===
No?
Look, Ross, you have what you want, youÂre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youÂre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
===
No. IÂm-IÂm to depressed to talk.
IÂll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
===
 Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
NO!!!
===
 No! Joey, we swore weÂd never tell!
 TheyÂll never understand!
===
 All right!! All right.  I got stung. Stung bad. I couldnÂt stand. I-I couldnÂt walk.
 We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnÂt think we could make it. 
===
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
And then Joey remembered something.
===
ThatÂs right I stepped up! SheÂs my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, IÂd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnÂt. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
 Joey kept screaming at me, ÂDo it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!Â Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
===
 WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
  Coffee house?
===
 Gin.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
===
Will you stop!
Okay. All right.
===
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
You donÂt turn and slide, you throw it out! IÂm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
===
Look, weÂre not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right, how about we, how Âbout we sell it.
===
All right. But, youÂre gonna have to tell them. 
 Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet?  They seem all right with it!
===
 Hey, hereÂs a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
===
Yeah.
 Stunning entertainment center. Fine,  fine Italian craftsmanship. 
===
Why? I love that thing.
You want it?
===
Oh no.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
===
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
All right look, IÂm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
===
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
 Nooo.
===
Oh. What do you do?
I canÂt believe you donÂt know what I do for a living!
===
 Dude, PhoebeÂs mom has got a huge peni...
 Let it go!!
===
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I donÂt think any of them are gonna work out.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
===
Pretty nice?
YouÂll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
===
You gotta take the canoe!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
===
He is right, isnÂt he?
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times heÂs wrong.
===
All right!!
IÂm coming already!!
===
 WHAT?!! 
Are you all right?!
===
Yeah...
 What happened?!!
===
 Awww, man! He promised he wouldnÂt take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
===
I was tryinÂ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what IÂm gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
===
 Oh my God! What happened?
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
===
 Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Oh, they said uh, ÂYou donÂt have insurance here, so stop calling us.Â
===
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
ThatÂs a good call. Right.
===
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And youÂre welcome to come back anytime.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, weÂd really appreciate it. 
===
 Huh?!
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
===
Just pickle.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
===
I donÂt understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a Âbig, dull dud.Â
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
===
Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.
Okay, I promise, IÂll end it.
===
 Yes.  Uh, canÂt you wait until tomorrow?  All right.  Unbelievable!!
Thanks.
===
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Okay. 
===
Why?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
===
Knowing youÂre here, waiting for me I think itÂs kinda exciting.
Okay. But if you donÂt come back soon,  thereÂs pretty much nothing I can do about it!
===
 IÂm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
How little?!
===
IÂm in my bossÂs car!
What?!
===
  What?!
 Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
===
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
===
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I canÂt get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and IÂm cold, and 
===
You never come into this office again!
Fine!
===
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, sheÂs very private about her office. Now I know why.
Hey, look, youÂre in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, sheÂs gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
===
 Yeah!!
No!
===
got it. ThereÂs gonna be rumours about this, thereÂs no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
===
 Hello, Chandler. 
 I love you. 
===
So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.
===
With such a sad history.
more Kims?
===
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesnÂt say ÂcoolÂ anymore.
===
 My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but IÂve missed the last 1200 times.
===
So why donÂt you quit?
having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
===
Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You canÂt say no to her, sheÂs like this lycra spandex covered gymÂtreat.
===
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
No!
===
So youÂre strong enough to face her on your own?
Oh no, youÂll have to come.
===
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that oneÂs actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Why donÂt you just give him to somebody else?
===
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Because thatÂs the only part of you he can see when heÂs on the table!
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Yes.  Yes!
===
One more time, "Hey, donÂt you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
===
Good! ThatÂs good!
Okay.   I wanna quit the gym.
===
You wanna quit?
I wanna quit the gym.
===
You do realize that you wonÂt have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
 I wanna quit the gym.
===
Sorry, members only.
 I wanna quit the gym.
===
Hey! So, did you quit?
No, I almost did, couldnÂt leave Ross there without a spotter!
===
Oh, umm, I was just yÂknow working out and ummÂ Oh, thatÂs it.
WeÂre doomed. Okay, theyÂre gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
===
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
YouÂre a genius!
===
Aww, man, now we wonÂt be bank buddies!
Now, thereÂs two reasons.
===
Hello.
Hi.
===
No-no.
No, weÂd just like to close them.
===
Hi, IÂm Karen.
I wanna quit the bank!
===
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
To pay for the gym.
===
Just go up to her and ask her out.  Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
I could die.
===
 Oh.
Hey! 
===
 But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes.  Pretty, huh? 
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
===
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
  Wish me luck.
===
 Good luck!
Wish it!  Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
===
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
===
With a K.
Oh-oh-hey!
===
Wow! You are really good at this.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
===
Hey!
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. 
===
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
===
Hi.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
===
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
===
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
===
Oh please!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
===
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
===
 Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Is it on?
===
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Hey! 
===
Oh my God!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
===
 What about the duck?
Well the duck can swim.
===
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
===
Yeah, she's...
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what? 
===
You love her.
No, I don't.
===
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Thank you, Ross.
===
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
All right.
===
Ohh!
All right.
===
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
===
Hey!
Okay. 
===
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
 Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
===
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
===
 We were just talking about you.
Really?!
===
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
 Right in there!
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
Hey guys.  Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
===
It's 4:30.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
===
Okay, I see what's going on here.
You-you do?
===
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
===
Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Okay.
===
 So? Huh? What do you think?
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
===
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
===
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Uhh, no-no thanks.
===
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. 
===
 I'll be right back.  What was that?
What?
===
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
===
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
I am pretending.
===
Well then, do it better!
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
===
Y'know if we ever go to war and youÂre captured, youÂre in for a 
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean itÂs bad enough that IÂm in love with my roommates girlfriendÂwhich by the way, I think she knows. Because every time weÂre in the room together thereÂs this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when IÂve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, sheÂs smooth! Smooth! 
===
Great! 
 Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
===
That would be Casey. WeÂre going out tonight.
GoinÂ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnÂt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
===
No, things are fine with Kathy. IÂm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
 What?
===
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! 
Wait! YouÂre going out with Kathy!
===
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Well, IÂm upsetÂfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. 
===
What is the big deal? ItÂs not like weÂre exclusive.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that sheÂs-sheÂs smart, and funny, and gets you.
===
You got all that from the back of her head?
All right look, I think itÂs time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
===
Okay, guys.
All right! Bring it on, youÂ
===
Here we go.  YÂknow, IÂve-IÂve never played my stuff for anyone before, so itÂs important that-that you understand itÂs about communicating very private emotions.  YÂknow, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. ThatÂs what IÂmÂ
 Oh my God! Play!
===
 Boy, that was-that was, ummÂ terrific.
Really, bitchinÂ!
===
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus itÂs just, itÂs so different from the stuff you usually hear.
You mean like, music?
===
 Hey!  Oh God, is that 
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
===
So is Joey around?
No-no, heÂs not back yet, but heÂll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
===
I uh, donÂt really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern.  Âof the boat.   Hello.
===
 Hey, itÂs me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened?
===
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that IÂll be there as soon as I can.
Why canÂt you tell her?
===
ÂCause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about toÂ
Joey! Joey!!
===
Yeah?
I thought your time ran out.
===
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of moreÂ
 Uhh, that was Joey. HeÂs running a little late, he says heÂs sorry.
===
Oh.
So I guess itÂs just uh, you and me then.
===
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I think it is!
===
So what did you do today?
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircutÂ
===
 Oh, it looks great!
Âand then it got canceled.
===
Well, I could cut it.
Really?! You do that?
===
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my auntÂs dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just donÂt make my tail too poofy.
===
You have really great hair.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  YÂknow who also has great hair is Joey!
===
Checking to see if itÂs even.
ÂKay.
===
 Hey dude, itÂs me.
Hey itÂs Joey!
===
Listen uh, IÂm really sorry, it looks like IÂm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnÂt there!
What?
===
Yeah, it mustÂve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Okay.
===
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Oh yeah man.  Joey. 
===
 Hey.  Oh no itÂs fine, donÂt worry about it.  Yeah-no, stop apologizing, itÂs okay.  Yeah! IÂll talk to you tomorrow.   I should uh, probably go.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah. 
===
I forgot my purse.
Oh. 
===
Horrible!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
===
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Okay!
===
No, but thatÂs bad!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! HereÂs what we do, we-we forget it happened.
===
What?!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means weÂre unhappy forever. Sound good?
===
Can you really do that?
I have to; heÂs my best friend, and youÂre seeing him.
===
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with youÂ
 Oh-no-no-no! DonÂt! DonÂt! See-see, youÂre getting me confused, IÂm starting to urn. 
===
IÂm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I-I think we have too.
===
Okay. Bye.
Bye.  Are you still out there?
===
Aww man! I canÂt believe I locked myself out again! 
Hang on buddy! 
===
 Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
I sure did.
===
Why?
Well, I just thought itÂd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
===
Well, youÂre amazing.
is amazing. 
===
 A TV as if it appears from nowhere! ThatÂs the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Well, yÂknow IÂm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
===
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I donÂt know.
===
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, IÂm gonna do that.
You mean with Casey.
===
No-no-no, I think IÂm gonna see how things go with Kathy. SheÂs pretty cool.
Or Casey.
===
No-no, Kathy.
Could be Casey.
===
No. No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
===
YÂknow what I think? I think somebodyÂs got a little crush on Casey. How Âbout I fix you two up? What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
===
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
I kissed Kathy.
===
Does Joey know?
you think heÂll understand this?
===
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldÂve just stepped aside.
Oh, donÂt say that! DonÂt say that. ThatÂs not true. Is it?
===
He loves you.
Then why didnÂt you tell me to do that?!!
===
I remember you did.
God!!  What am I gonna do?!
===
Well, Chandler, youÂre gonna have to tell him.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
===
Because you do.
Yeah, I know.
===
Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
Is that a real thing?
===
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
===
WhatÂs up?
ItÂs-itÂs about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
===
You do?
Yeah.
===
Well, youÂre timing couldnÂt be better. SheÂs not my girlfriend anymore.
What?
===
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Oh uh, when?
===
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thatÂs why I let people watch.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
===
Well, IÂve been better. But, IÂm all right. So you like her huh?
Yes, but I-I uh, donÂt have too.
===
No-no-no, no itÂs uh, itÂs okay.
Yeah?
===
Yeah. You know why? ÂCause you came to me first.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
===
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youÂre work cut out for you. ÂCause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that sheÂs into some other guy. SoÂ
See uh, thatÂs-thatÂs actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
===
Who?
ItÂs me. IÂm the other guy.
===
What?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another andÂ
===
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
===
What?!! ThatÂs even worse!!
How is that worse?!
===
I donÂt know! But itÂs the same!
Look, IÂm sorry! But thereÂs nothing I can do, I think IÂm in love with her!
===
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
YouÂre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
===
Over the line?! You-youÂre-youÂre so far past the line, that you-you canÂt even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
===
Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, yÂknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and thereÂs a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that IÂm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably becauseÂ
===
 Hello.
 Hey, itÂs me. I know you canÂt stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought IÂd try and apologize over the phone. All IÂ 
===
 Hello.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but IÂmÂ 
===
So are things with you and Joey any better?
They couldnÂt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
===
I know, but all that work youÂre doing to get it ready, I justÂ 
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, Âcause I wanna trade for her.
===
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
===
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, itÂs like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, letÂs trade!
Oh thatÂs not true! ThatÂs not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with itÂ  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on itÂ  Her initialsÂ
===
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Op, y'know what though, itÂs kindÂve a girlie briefcase.
===
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
===
You donÂt have to do that, Ross and Joey arenÂt here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Thanks.
===
 People are trying to sleep in here!
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
===
Oh, yÂknow what, I canÂt, it really kills.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
===
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I canÂt go to him when I donÂt have a boyfriend!
HeÂs really picky about his patients.
===
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
 All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
===
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but IÂm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Oh yÂknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
===
Really?! Wow! ThatÂs-thatÂs so nice, what are you gonna get me?
I donÂt know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
===
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Oh no-no-no, you donÂt want to do that, then youÂre gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
===
Oh, thatÂs not true! IÂve got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Like?
===
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
===
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uhÂ
Big dog?
===
Oh.
Hey Joe.
===
My folks.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
===
I donÂt know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
What?!
===
Yeah, yÂknow at first I thought we could talk about this yÂknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I donÂt think IÂ
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that IÂll stop seeing her?
===
Look, itÂs not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I donÂt want to live with some one who doesnÂt know what it is to be a friend. So, IÂll see ya. 
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
===
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down! 
What?
===
Yeah! But if wouldÂve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnÂt have worried about it so much! See you around!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?
===
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
 Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
===
Chandler?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
===
  Now, weÂll see.
Air hole! Air hole!! 
===
And Rachel.  And thatÂs Chandler.
How do ya do.
===
Oh, IÂll get it. 
Gotcha! 
===
That doesnÂt sound like thinking to me!
Sorry!
===
YÂknow I donÂt think you should be talking at all in there! I think youÂve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Okay, okay, you got it!
===
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnÂt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youÂre just an idiot in a box!
YouÂre right, and IÂm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wonÂt say another word tonight.
===
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Absolutely!
===
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there!  Get out of there!
So?
===
Yeah, weÂre gonna be fine! Get out!
Yeah?
===
Yeah, you did some real good thinkinÂ in there.
Man, this isÂ 
===
Come on, no peeking! 
Our eyes are closed and weÂre about to cross the street. Very good.
===
Oh.
 Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
===
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
KathyÂs with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
===
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
IÂm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
===
IÂm gonna call after you!
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
===
Will you calm down, heÂs just a human guy.
Look you donÂt understand, Gandolf is amazing. YÂknow youÂre never know whatÂs gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! 
===
Really?!
Oh yeah, itÂs beautiful country up there.
===
 Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
like last time.
===
All right, IÂll see you guys.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
===
Okay. 
 Hello.   ItÂs Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then. 
===
What happened?
HeÂs not gonna make it, heÂs stuck in Chicago.
===
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
===
No! I balanced my checkbook. 
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
===
So what if he didnÂt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
all night!
===
Yeah! All right? LetÂs go!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
===
Yeah!!!
All right!!
===
 Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
===
Yeah.
Well, those were seals, man.
===
All right, so weÂll get a little coffee, and get energized, and weÂll head back out.
Yeah, all right.
===
So, weÂre having fun, right?
Yeah.
===
IÂm kinda beat.
Actually, me too.
===
Are you serious?!
Yeah.
===
Yeah, me too.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
===
Yeah, I know.
YÂknow what? WeÂre not sad, weÂre not sad, weÂre just not 21 anymore. YÂknow? IÂm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
===
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Yeah!
===
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so sheÂd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
===
No, IÂm getting back down Âcause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but sheÂs like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
How can she be great if sheÂs from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldÂve killed in Albany.
===
Umm, that paperÂs two weeks old. 
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I canÂt believe I missed it.
===
Well, I know what IÂm giving you for Christmas.
YÂknow what? ThereÂs some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
===
Yeah! Wait a minute, itÂs been a long time that IÂve been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, IÂm-IÂm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
===
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I donÂt like guys with boring jobs.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
===
I would love too, but I canÂt! I mean I just canÂt, you know that IÂm not good at confrontation.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whoÂs boss.
===
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct 
 Yes.
===
I didnÂt think you were gay. I do now.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
===
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, IÂm not looking for any thing serious.
Oh, yÂknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
 Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
===
got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh well, thatÂs uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
===
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
 Hello, children!
===
Hey!
 Have I got the 50 guys for you!
===
Really?!
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! TheyÂre buying me drinks! TheyÂre giving me stuff!  Knicks tonight?
===
Sure! Where are the seats?
Wherever! IÂve got like 20!
===
So, will I like any of these guys?
YÂknow what, IÂm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
===
Chandler!
Guys are signing over their 401-KÂs to me?
===
 You work with robots!!
 Yes.  Okay, thereÂs this one guy, Patrick, I think youÂre gonna like him, heÂs really nice, heÂs funny, heÂs a swimmer.
===
Ohh, I like swimmerÂs bodies!
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
===
Op, I like credit cards!
See, IÂm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
===
Well, so what does he do?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
===
Your company has a fine foods division?
ItÂs a big company, I donÂtÂif youÂIÂ
===
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Oh yeah! With who?
===
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Yeah.
===
Hey!
Hey, man!
===
 Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Well, like father, like son.
===
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you werenÂt looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
===
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnÂt tell him that, though? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
===
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You donÂt tell the guy that!
Why not?! IÂd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getÂoh I see.
===
 Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merryÂ
 Oh, yÂknow, yÂknow what Pheebs?
===
What?
IÂm not Jewish, soÂ
===
decorate his tree with floss, but you donÂt hear him complaining do you? God! 
Bad dream?
===
I wasnÂt sleeping.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was PhoebeÂs song about?
===
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Prague?
===
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
I did! I absolutely did!
===
You idiot!!
IÂm sure youÂre right, but why?
===
You donÂt tell a guy that youÂre looking for a serious relationship! You donÂt tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Oh, man. IÂm sorry, IÂm so-so sorry.
===
be allowed to talk to people!
I know! I know!
===
Oh! See just IÂm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! 
Well, yÂknow, youÂre-youÂre gonna meet somebody! YouÂre a great catch! YÂknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnÂt have to lie once. 
===
Really?
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
===
No.
Oh, it doesnÂt matter.  Hey, yÂknow what, IÂve got two tickets to tonightÂs Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
===
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Well, actually itÂs a hockey team, so itÂs angry Canadians with no teeth.
===
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
So there is no good time to ask that question.
===
 Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got.
I donÂt know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
===
What?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
===
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Well, you-you know what I meant.
===
No, you messed it up. YouÂre stupid.
So what job did you get Joe?
===
Umm,  I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Oh, yeah, sure, itÂs not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
===
You guys are really rightÂthere arenÂt you?
Yes. Right where?
===
In the beginning where yÂknow itÂs all sex and talking and sex and talking andÂ
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
===
And the sex?
All right, we havenÂt had sex yet. Okay, whatÂs the big deal? YÂknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
===
Why? Just because youÂre not mature enough to understand something like that?!
No, heÂs right, IÂm totally lying.
===
Then what is it?
Well, KathyÂs last boyfriend was Joey.
===
And youÂre afraid you wonÂt be able toÂfill his shoes.
No, IÂm afraid I wonÂt be able to make love as well as him.
===
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
===
So big deal, so JoeyÂs had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnÂt mean heÂs great in bed.
We share a wall! So either heÂs great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
===
Sweetie, with you itÂs gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, Âcause you-you guys are in love.
Yeah?
===
Go on.
All right, all right, IÂll go sleep with my girlfriend. But IÂm just doing it for you guys.
===
Hey!
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
===
 So, did you do it?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
===
Uh-oh, it was bad?
It was fine, yÂknow? But she didnÂt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, IÂm all right with it."
===
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yÂknow, I know where everything goes, itÂs always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! SomebodyÂs killing her in there!"
===
All right, IÂm gonna show you something a lot of guys donÂt know. Rach, give me that pad, please?  All right. NowÂ
Look, you donÂt have to draw an actual woÂwhoa! SheÂs hot!
===
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
 There are seven?!
===
Let me see that.  Oh, yeah.
 ThatÂs one?
===
ItÂs kind of an important one!
Oh, yÂknow-yÂknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
===
 Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
That-thatÂs bad?
===
is that noise?
You!
===
What kind of changes?
Well the vet seems to think thatÂs sheÂs becoming a rooster.  WeÂre getting a second opinion.
===
Oh, theyÂre just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
===
SheÂs mad because I know todayÂs her laundry day and that means sheÂs wearing her old lady underpants.
I can check that for ya.
===
I justÂI canÂt believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
===
Yeah, whatÂs that about?
 And youÂ Ross, I believe, if you check RachelÂs bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
===
Five.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
===
WeÂll be starting with apples.
 Stop that now!
===
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Diet soda.
===
Yes. Yes. Yes. 
Orange juice.
===
Okay, the last thingÂ
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! 
===
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
I got it! ScotchÂ tape. 
===
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Well, we used thereÂs up last night making scary faces.
===
Aww, man!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
===
ItÂs heads.  Gentlemen, pick your category.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
===
 The Irish gig guy?!
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
===
 Nana?
She has a real name.
===
 Althea!
Althea?! What are you doing?! 
===
I took a shot.
You're shooting with Althea?!
===
Althea is correct.
Nice shooting!
===
I knew that! Rachel! Use youÂre head!
Actually, itÂs Miss Chinandolor Bong.
===
Viva Las Gaygas!
Unfortunately that is correct.
===
good at lighting rounds.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, weÂre gonna destroy you.
===
Huh, wanna bet?
Well, IÂm so confused as to what weÂve been doing so farÂ
===
150 dollars.
Say 200?
===
Look, we are not gonnaÂ
 All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
===
 Dah!! 
But if we win, we get your apartment.
===
Okay.
Okay. 
===
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Oh! 
===
Everyday use.
Fancy.
===
Guest.
Fancy guest.
===
No, 19.
Thanks man.
===
Oh my God.
YES!!!
===
I call MonicaÂs room!
You canÂt just call MonicaÂs room.
===
Yeah.  I bet you canÂt guess what color my tonsils are? IÂll bet the apartment!
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. ItÂs too nice.
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
 Oh my God! I canÂt believe you guys are actually think youÂre moving in here!
Well believe it baby!
===
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
I knew it!
===
I donÂt care, IÂm not going anywhere.
Cool, girl roommate.
===
DonÂt blame the questions!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
===
Did you see the size of the closets?!
I canÂt believe we live here!
===
People can hear you.
I know!!
===
That is one good looking man!
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
===
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookinÂ guy.
wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
===
a good idea for a business!
IÂm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyÂre gonna go to their cast parties and heÂs gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itÂll be like, "So whereÂs your boyfriend, whatÂs-his-name, Chester?" And sheÂll go, "No-no-no, itÂs Chandler." And heÂll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
===
 That-that is a good trick.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
===
Well okay, so then youÂre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as itÂs hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. ItÂs when the heat goes away, thatÂs when youÂre in trouble.
Really?
===
YÂknow what, I donÂt know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Yeah, I know butÂ
===
All right, letÂs not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
===
Clearly, IÂm having sex with him?
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
===
Okay, so let me just get this straight. YouÂre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
YÂknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youÂre up there every night, youÂre naked, touching, kissing.
===
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! IÂm-IÂm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
===
Oh, wow. I canÂt believe youÂre throwing that in my face.
Well, that is what happened, and I donÂt even see you denying this!
===
IÂll tell you what, Chandler, why donÂt you call me when you grow up!
to happen anytime soon!
===
So you were right?
I confronted her, and she didnÂt deny it!  I donÂt live here! 
===

Yes! See you and I have always been likeÂ
===
No, sorry.
All right, maybe I should call her.
===
HeÂs right, what she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
===
How might you be wrong?
Well y'know, what if she didnÂt actually sleep with the guy?
===
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
===
ThatÂs all youÂre basing this on?
ThatÂs not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
===
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! ThereÂs a lot of theories that didnÂt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Oh my God!!
===
 Hey.
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that IÂm sorry. YÂknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
===
Oh wow. I really wish youÂd call me.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yÂknow I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ÂCause weÂve had our first fight, and now we can move on. YÂknow, I know for meÂ NickÂs pants?
===
Yeah.
one!
===
HowÂd it go?
Well, she wasnÂt sleeping with him.
===
Oh good!
She is now.
===
How? How is your fault?
Because, I-I shouldÂve called! YÂknow if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldÂve gone out with Nick, and they wouldÂve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
===
Yeah.
 Would you give me one minute!! Please.
===
Hey! YouÂre wearing pants!
ThatÂs right! Where are the guys? IÂm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
===
ItÂs 9:30 in the morning!
They got a breakfast buffet.
===
Hello.  Oh, hey Ross!
Ooh, let me talk to him!
===
Oh-oh, my God!
Well, can I justÂ
===
 Shh!!  Wait, what?
SheÂs shhing me! ItÂs my phone and sheÂs shhing me!
===
TheyÂre in Vermont!! How could this happen?! 
Ow!
===
HowÂhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! 
Maybe, she doesnÂt hit him all the time. 
===
I donÂt get this! She was horrible! 
Okay, IÂm going to go stand over there. 
===
A couple of days.
YÂknow, I knew something like this was going to happen. 
===
What are you doing?! Chandler! You canÂt just go back a phase!
Yes you can. YouÂre thinking about time, you canÂt go back in time.
===
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
 No you canÂt.
===
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
You donÂt want to be guys, youÂd be all hairy and wouldnÂt live as long. 
===
YÂknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Okay. 
===
 Okay, IÂve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
No thanks, Mom!
===
Oh! And donÂt let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Ahh, come on! YÂknow whatÂyÂknow what, I think IÂm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
===
Well, if you think it will help.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours IÂm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, IÂm gonna get so drunk, IÂm gonna wanna call Janice
===
You should! How is she?
Ohhh!!
===
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
===
No, I donÂt.
All right, well IÂm gonna put my sweats back on.
===
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, yÂknow what, you were right, you were right. We really werenÂt great at being guys, but you know why? Because weÂre girls.
Yeah?
===
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Stripping!
===
Yeah. And yÂknow, if you wanna cry, thatÂs okay too.
Okay, look, IÂm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
===
Come on! Chandler!
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnÂt picture myself with any of them. 
===
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thighÂ
 Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
===
Really?!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
===
ThatÂs-thatÂs not Phase Three.
Well, IÂm there too!
===
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Stop it! YouÂre killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
===
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Where I donÂt want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
===
I donÂt wanna.
Please?
===
I wanted to go to the strip club!
I know, I know, but youÂre gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
===
I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.
Oh, thatÂs fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
===
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
===
Chandler, thereÂs a guy right over there. 
mailman!   Hi. How are ya?
===
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
 Hello!
===
Janice?!
IsnÂt this amazing? 
===
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi!  And you, sweetie, IÂll see you tonight.
Okay. Bye.
===
Bye.
Bye.
===
Bye.
Bye.
===
Bye.
B-bye!
===
Bye-bye.
Bye.   I canÂt stand the woman! 
===
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityÂWell, theyÂre all back! YÂknow? And sheÂs picked up like nine new ones!
===
So what are you doing bringing her here?! ThereÂs people here!
DonÂt worry about it. IÂm taking care of it tonight. 
===
been able to break up with her.
 Well, I donÂt have to break up with her this time. WeÂre not involved! IÂm going to do a pre-emptive strike! IÂm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!  
===
Oh, look at us! Who wouldÂve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. 
 Okay, we have to talk. IÂm just getting out of a very serious relationshipÂ
===
I know! And IÂm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
===
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
===
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
No! No! Not, Paris. 
===
When?
I donÂt know exactly.
===
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I do know that itÂs some time tomorrow.
===
 Janice.
YÂknow uh, you didnÂt really have to help me pack.
===
Hey-hey, whatÂs going on?
Oh, IÂm packing. YÂknow IÂm-IÂm packing Âcause IÂm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
===
Okay, Chandler, come on!
 Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me!
===
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! ItÂs not like heÂsÂChandler!
 Thanks!
===
Oh please. Every moment is precious. YÂknow? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends donÂt really seem to care too much that youÂre leaving.
Well, weÂre really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
===
On no! No! ItÂs not good-bye, IÂm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Okay. Then I guess itÂs just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
===
One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
===
IÂm sorry sir, I donÂt understand. 
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
===
Are you travelling with a child?
No. All right, yÂknow what, sheÂs  gonna think that IÂm handing you a credit card, but what IÂm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
===
 This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
===
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. IÂll wait for you. Do you even know how long youÂre going to be gone?
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
===
Oh. Well, IÂll right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. 
===
Chandler?
No!
===
Chandler! 
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
===
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Well, I then guess IÂm going to Yemen! IÂm going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
===
God! Ooh! What is that smell? ItÂs coming from the bathroom. Ooh! 
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
===
Well, JoshuaÂs coming in tomorrow and since I donÂt have the guts to ask him out, IÂm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of styleÂwhat did you throw away?
===
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!
===
Hey thatÂs what all my relationships are like.
know in two weeks thatÂs it.
===
 Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, yÂknow? And I got nauseous.
Maybe thatÂs because soy-burgers suck!
===
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
What are you talking about?
===
Uhh, because IÂm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick heÂs looking over here, say something funny.
Like what?
===
What-what-what is so funny?
I said, "Like what?"
===
And lucky means, more cleavage? 
Does for me.
===
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girlÂ
She was a welder.
===
YÂknow it doesnÂt matter how much IÂm craving it. YÂknow why IÂm never gonna eat meat? Because itÂs murder, cold blooded murder.
Okay. 
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
YouÂre a pathetic loser, right?
Oh-ho, yeah!
===
 What is that?
TreegerÂs snaking the shower drain.
===
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustÂve hit something on the remote.
Do we pay for this?
===
No, we didnÂt even pay our cable billÂmaybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldnÂt pay our phone billÂfree phone sex.
===
 Whoa, hey, that ladyÂs all kinds of naked.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
===
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
===
 Oh no-no-no-no!
We donÂt know what could make this go away.
===
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
around the TV!
===
Oh no-no-no! 
We still have porn.
===
Ohh, IÂm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. YÂknow, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. 
Or a job where you donÂt have to carry a table.
===
WhatÂs that song? It has been in my head all day long.
ItÂs the theme from Good Will Humping.
===
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
===
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about, Âcause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
They donÂt really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
===
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
===
Then you go to Tokyo.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, itÂs over.
===
It is not over! YouÂre over!
What?
===
You know!
Okay.  Good one.
===
Hey!
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
===
Well, so, why donÂt you just turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
===
Oh this, well IÂm glad you asked.  Now, donÂt you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?  Ahh! Now, I know what youÂre thinkingÂ
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
===
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
WhatÂs the second part of your plan?
===
IÂm not proving anything. Okay, IÂm done listening to you. If I hadnÂt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never wouldÂve put my fist through the wall!
You put your fist through the wall?
===
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what IÂve got?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
===
Hey.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didnÂt ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
===
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
===
Noo! Nothing!
YÂknow what, we have to turn off the porn.
===
One.
Two.
===
ThatÂs kinda nice.
Yeah, thatÂs kinda a relief.
===
Yeah!!
We have free porn here!!!
===
Hey!
true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
===
 No. No. No.  Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. 
WouldnÂt that be Frank the III?
===
Hey!
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
===
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name thatÂs really like, yÂknow strong and confident, yÂknow? Like-like Exxon. 
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
===
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. JoeyÂs your pal. JoeyÂs your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyÂre hanging out with Joey."
Hey, yÂknow what, if youÂre gonna do that, if youÂre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! ChandlerÂs funny, sophisticated, and heÂs very loveable, once you get to know him.
===
Oh well, hey, JoeyÂs loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, heÂll be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, heÂll be there. And heÂll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youÂre really hot.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
So uh, Emily called last nightÂ
youÂre giving me the message!
===
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
===
No, but IÂm gonna!
Hi! Hi! YouÂre crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
===
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Raymond Chandler.
===
Someone you didnÂt make up!
famous JoeyÂs. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
===
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if itÂs like yÂknow, Chanoey?
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, heÂll never be President. ThereÂs never gonna be a President Joey.
===
All right look man, I didnÂt want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! ItÂs not even a name; itÂs barely even a word. Okay? ItÂs kinda like chandelier, but itÂs not! All right? ItÂs a stupid, stupid 
Wow, youÂre, youÂre right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
===
IÂm sorry man, I didnÂtÂIÂm-IÂm sorry. IÂm sorry.  
Okay.
===
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
No, no, youÂre right, it is a ridiculous name!
===
ItÂs not that bad.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
===
So, youÂre just Bing?
I have no name.
===
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
===
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
===
Umm, Gene.
ItÂs Clint. ItÂs Clint! 
===
Drum roll.
 Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
===
Nah, youÂre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
===
YouÂre actually going through with this?
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, itÂs probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with womenÂ So, as of 4 oÂclock tomorrow, IÂm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
===
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In factÂyes,  IÂm, IÂm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, IÂm-IÂm, IÂm gonna, IÂm gonna name the baby Chandler.
 Really?!
===
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Okay. Thanks.
===
Okay!
You wanna hug it out?
===
Yay! 
Yay! 
===
YayÂohÂyay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Okay!
===
Ooh, uhÂ 
Bye, Pheebs!
===
 Hello!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
===
Excuse me.
Your pants!
===
What?
Santa pants.  Santa ClausÂs pants.
===
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I donÂt belong here."
===
Yeah!
Yeah we do!
===
Boy! I didnÂt see that coming!
Are you serious?
===
What do you say?
Forget it! Okay, IÂm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
===
Have you even had a girl up here?
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
===
Come on!
 Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
===
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Forget it! Okay, IÂm not giving up the apartment.
===
Hey!
Oh my God!
===
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
You do know that Wham broke up?
===
Oh-no, donÂt try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Where is Emily?
===
Ugh, sheÂs saying good-bye to her uncle.
Man, didnÂt she like just get here?
===
Yeah!! Yeah!
Easy tiger.
===
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, itÂs-itÂs so great. But at the same time IÂm thinking, "Well, IÂm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
So what are you going to do?
===
I could ask her to live with me!
Are you serious?
===
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Because youÂve only known her for six weeks! Okay, IÂve got a carton of milk in my fridge IÂve had a longer relationship with!
===
Look guys, when IÂm with her itÂs-itÂs-itÂs like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, yÂknow?
And I love the milk! But, IÂm not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now.
===
Yeah, no, youÂre right, I know, youÂre right, IÂm not, IÂm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. 
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
===
Or IÂll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
No thank you.
===
ItÂs the Knicks!
Screw the Knicks!
===
Whoa!
I didnÂt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
===
Huh.
And the Knicks rule all.
===
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
No. No. WeÂre not gonna do that, yÂknow why? Because its not an even trade.
===
All right, so what do you say?
No!
===
Oh, just do it!!
Op, op, IÂm convinced!
===
Come on man, you know IÂd do it for you! Because, youÂre my best friend.
All right, but you canÂt use that again for a whole year. IÂm in.
===
Okay! 
Okay!
===
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Fine, letÂs do it.
===
Yeah! Here!  Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
===
Okay.  Four.
ThatÂs a low one!
===
Uh-huh, not as high asÂ It worked! King!
Yeah baby!
===
I donÂt know!
Tickets please!  ThatÂs courtside baby!
===
Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
No they didnÂt!
===
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? YÂknow, kinda like a peace offering.
Oh yeah, thatÂs very nice. Plus, yÂknow they were free and theyÂre too small.
===
Hey, want a beer?   WHOA!!!!
I KNOW!!!
===
WeÂll discuss it, in the morning! 
What the hell is going on?!
===
No, weÂre not! WeÂre not leaving!
Well, youÂre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, weÂre switching it back! ThereÂs nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
===
I donÂt know.
What?
===
I donÂt want to move again! 
I donÂt care, this is our apartment! And they stoleÂyou stole itÂour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. IÂm getting back right now!
===
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You canÂt offer anything to us!
===
That was one good minute!
Good night.
===
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Okay!
===
You donÂt need to fill these silences.
Oh, okay, thanks. 
===
Chandler, thatÂs like your fourth cup of coffee!
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because IÂm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
===
 Oh, you should here me.
ItÂs not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
===
Look, I told ya, IÂm not going to any clinic! I donÂt have a problem, youÂre the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
They donÂt have those.
===
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Next time you snore, IÂm rolling ya over!
===
 Hey guys!
Hey, all right!
===
Okay.
Oh, sheÂs got you running errands, yÂknow, picking up wedding dressesÂ  Wah-pah!
===
WhatÂs wah-pah?
YÂknow, whipped! Wah-pah!
===
ThatÂs not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
ThatÂs what I did. Wah-pah!
===
This sucks! I didnÂt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! IÂm so tired!
ItÂs 6:00.
===
 Hi!
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thatÂs, I think thatÂs really cool.
===
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? ThereÂs nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnÂt for me and Joshua. YÂknow, theyÂre not gonna get married anyway!
What?
===
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast itÂs ridiculous! I mean, theyÂre gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyÂve done and theyÂre call the whole thing off. IÂm telling ya, youÂre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youÂre dancing at thereÂs.
Yeah, well, I donÂt dance at weddings.
===
Why not?
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like thisÂ 
===
Hey man.
Hey!
===
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Nothing.
===
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study.  Uh, sir? 
 Yes he did.
===
What?!
YouÂre coming on to the entire room!  IÂm Chandler.
===
IÂm Marjorie.
Hi.
===
Hi.
You mind if IÂ
===
I talk in my sleep.
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
===
Oh, youÂre such a cheater!
 Hello! Little ones.
===
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.  Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
===
Oh, howÂd that happen?
Because IÂm cooler.
===
No, seriously.
Well sheÂs, sheÂs the kinda girlÂJoey was unconscious. 
===
 I know I donÂt have too! It tastes good. 
Plus, you look cool.
===
is getting married.
Phoebe is, making people.
===
EverybodyÂs doing stuff!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
===
 We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
===
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Why not?! I mean itÂs just, itÂs just climbing! ItÂs just, itÂs just steep!
===
Yeah!
WeÂre going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
===
WeÂre gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Yeah baby!
===
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and yÂknow you can die. And, you would die!
 Yeah, wellÂ
===
We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, we could do that without yÂknow risking our lives at all!
===
So you guysÂll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeeeeahhhh.
===
Awful! Horrible!
She was not good. Not good.
===
Ewwwww!
Uh-oh.
===
Oooh look! IsnÂt this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
 Hello!
===
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to RossÂs wedding?
 Noo.
===
IÂm so jealous youÂre all going! I canÂt believe I never knew that you canÂt fly in your third trimester!
I didnÂt know that.
===
WhatÂs this? Is this RossÂs wedding invitation?
See, maybe thatÂs the one we shouldÂve actually hidden.
===
Oh, honey, I donÂt know. IÂ
This isnÂt one of those uh, yÂknow "If she doesnÂt come, we-we donÂt, we donÂt come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticketÂ
===
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's. 
===
I can't believe he did this.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
===
What did you just say?
 F-hah.... flennin....
===
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
===
Hey guys!
Hey.
===
All right, hereÂs the ring.  
 Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, donÂt you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Oh, itÂs awkward. ItÂs awkward. ItÂs awkward.
===
Come on Ross! Look, I-I donÂt have any brothers; IÂll never get to be a best man!
You can be the best man when I get married.
===
 Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Oh no-no-no, youÂyeah, of course you get to be my best man.
===
 What about me?! You-you just said I could!
IÂm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
===
be me?!HeyHey!
IÂm not evenÂ IÂm not evenÂ
===
Okay! WeÂll need a six-pack of 
 Hey guys, what are you doing?
===
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
===
Yeah, see, I donÂt think itÂs gonna that difficult considering this one 
Oh, IÂm Ross. IÂm Ross. IÂm too good for the Hut; IÂm too good for the Hut.
===
Okay, see ya later.
See ya.  Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
===
Well, thereÂs gonna be strippers there. He didnÂt say anything about no strippers.
He just said, "No strippers."
===
Good call!
 Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. IÂve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
===
WhatÂs my last name?
Central Perk?
===
Oh-oh! 
 Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh,  so is the position of the bride.
===
 The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
 What?
===
The ring is gone!
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisÂAh-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! YouÂre the worst best man ever!
===
Dude, this isnÂt funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everythingÂs cool! I wake up this morning, the stripperÂs gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
===
 Hey guys!
Hey!
===
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? 
===
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
So you might say, itÂs a magic ring.
===
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why donÂt you be my best man."
===
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-IÂ
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
===
Did anybody call for security?
 You be cool. 
===
WhereÂs my ring? My dead grandmotherÂs wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Way to be cool, man.
===
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I donÂt need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Marry me. 
===
So! Things can go wrong! You donÂt know! What if he doesnÂt make it?!
He will, Joe.
===
No, itÂs not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Hey, come on, itÂs not your fault.
===
Yeah, it is! You wouldnÂt have lost the ring, right? YÂknow what, Ross you were right from the start, he  should be your best man.
No, you should.
===
get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys. 
Really?
===
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are myÂ I mean, IÂm lucky to have just one goodÂ 
Thanks man.
===
 I gotta go check something over here. 
What a baby.
===
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! 
Six-hour trip to London. ThatÂs a lot of Monica.
===
ItÂs all London, baby! Here we go. 
You got your passport?
===
Ohh!! 
There it is.
===
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
 All right! LetÂs do it!
===
London baby!
Okay, Âcause thatÂs not gonna get annoying.
===
 London baby!!
Hey, yÂknow what? I was wrong.
===
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Hey! 
===
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, itÂs on the counter in your apartment.
Oh. 
===
Fine. YouÂll-youÂll watch it on video when we get back.
 Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
===
Come on! Do something!
I am, IÂm ignoring you.
===
Okay, here!  I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. 
Oh, what the hell is that?
===
ItÂs London, baby! All right, the hotelÂs here.  Wait. No, we wanna goÂ No. I know.  IÂm gonna have to go into the map. 
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
===
I got it!  Here we go.
Okay. Listen-listen, weÂre not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
===
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey IÂve ever seen. Hey!  Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
I think itÂs great. ItÂs great. YÂknow, theyÂre thinking of changing the name of this place.
===
Really? To what?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
===
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. ThatÂs the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I donÂt have to buy that, "IÂm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
===
Well, I like it. Here you go. 
All right, look, youÂre not really gonna buy that are you? DonÂt you think youÂve embarrassed me enough for one day?
===
Oh, I embarrass you? 
How can I answer that when IÂm pretending I donÂt know you?
===
HeÂs just jealous. YouÂll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
===
 TheyÂre all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yÂknow, youÂre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
===
Thanks.
Okay, wait. All right, thatÂs it, okay, IÂm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! 
===
Hey.
Hey. 
===
Oh.  Sorry!
No-no-no, yÂknow what? I really shouldnÂt have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnÂt cool. And if it makes you feel any better, IÂve had a really lousy day.
===
Me too.
Yeah?
===
Hi Chandler!  
ThatÂsÂ ThatÂs wasÂ
===
Joey says you donÂt really like his hat, but I think itÂs kinda dashing.
How did you? How? How?
===
UmmÂ
IÂm gonna go to the bathroom.
===
Come on. 
That was pretty intense huh?
===
Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didnÂt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
 I hope he did!
===
Well, that went well. Yeah.
It couldÂve been worse, he couldÂve shot her.
===
Hey.
Oh wow, I hope you donÂt take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, IÂm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
===
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Seven times!
===
I blame London.
Bad London! 
===
So look umm, while weÂre st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Well, I donÂt see that we have a choice. But, when weÂre back home, we donÂt do it.
===
Only here.
YÂknow, I saw a wine cellar downstairsÂ
===
IÂll meet you there in two minutes.
Okay! 
===
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Forget it, thatÂs off.
===
ThatÂs true.
The manÂs got a point.
===
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.
===
name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!  Okay, donÂt believe me, I know IÂm rightÂdo you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
===
Yes, I want to change. And why-why donÂt you go down and get us a table?
Yeah, weÂll be down in like five minutes.
===
Hello? Oh, Pheebs!  ItÂs Phoebe!
Oh, yayÂ
===
Okay, Pheebs, yÂknow what, letÂs look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So thenÂ
 Hey, listen, why donÂt we go change in my room?
===
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Well, IÂve got a girl in here.
===
No you donÂt, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Well, weÂre-weÂre hanging out in here!
===
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Well, I suppose IÂd have to say you!! But, what if weÂre watching a movie in here?
===
You really think this is okay?
Well, Ross and Emily arenÂt gonna use it.
===
Okay!
Okay!
===
 Emily?!
Nope, not under here!
===
No, IÂve looked everywhere!
Well, you couldnÂt have looked everywhere or else you wouldÂve found her!
===
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
===
Or 45.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. 
===
Well, itÂs getting late.
Yeah, weÂre gonna go.
===
Ugh, yÂknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Yeah, itÂs a very large plane.
===
 ThatÂs cool.
But, weÂll stay here with you.
===
I know, IÂve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, donÂt you think?
We canÂt do that thatÂs insane. I mean ÂAÂ he could wake up and ÂBÂ yÂknow, letÂs go for it.
===
IÂm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe IÂll see you there in a bit?
ÂKay!
===
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
===
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yÂknow, you think IÂll ever get there?
Yes.
===
Thanks man. 
Okay man. 
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
 You ate meat!   You had sex! 
No we didnÂt!
===
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yes! Good thing we have that, ÂNot in New YorkÂ rule.
===
Right. Umm, listen since weÂre-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was RossÂs motherÂ
Right.
===
Well, an-anyway, I justÂthat night meant a lot to me, I guess IÂm just trying to say thanks.
Oh. YÂknow, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasnÂt because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me Âcause, youÂre really hot! Is that okay?
===
 ThatÂs okay.
And IÂm cute too.
===
And youÂre cute too.
Thank you!  All right, I gotta go unpack.
===
Okay.
Bye. 
===
That counts!
Oh, good! 
===
You look cute in bubbles.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
===
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
===
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
===
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
===
 Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
===
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
===
Bodington's! Woohoo! 
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
===
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
===
 Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!  Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
===
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh that's not true.
===
are now in control of my love life.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
===
are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. 
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
===
What took you so long?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
===
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!" 
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. 
===
 Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justÂy'knowÂstop it!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
===
Phoebe!
Hey, Pheebs!
===
Okay, woo! Hi.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a littleÂ Y'know, it didn't have anyÂ It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
===
Okay, let's go!
Atlantic City!
===
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
===
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
===
Do you know anything about women?
No.
===
That's all right. 
Okay. 
===
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
That's right.
===
I'm having my first contraction!
Oh no.
===
Ooh, it's not bad.
Okay.
===
Oh!  And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! 
Hey! You okay?
===
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. 
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
===
That's what it sounded like.
All rightÂ
===
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
===
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Really? Male nurses?
===
Yeah, I was bummed too.
So they're going on dates? When?
===
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
===
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
All right.
===
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
===
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I 
Fine! Maybe I will too!
===
looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
===
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh.
===
it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Sure.  And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. 
===
Oh, great!
 Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
===
No.
All right. Very good.
===
Uh, bye Monica.
Bye, momi-moo.
===
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!! 
Yes!
===
Chandler's a girl!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
===
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it!
===
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, soÂ
===
 Know when to stop.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
===
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.
Right!
===
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
===
They're gonna call her Chandler.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
===
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
 Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
===
 Hey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
===
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
===
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I donÂt think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
===
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Yes!
===
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
 Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
===
Sure!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
===
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Yes!
===
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm 
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
===
Yeah.
That's true!
===
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
true!
===
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? 
Hey, there he is! There he is!
===
 Hi Chandler.
Hey!
===
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars. 
===

Expect it in 4-6 weeks.  Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
===
Yeah, so?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
===
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Why?
===
Why? 
What's your point?
===
Keep talking.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OHÂMYÂGOD.
===
Really?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
===
Well, if we owe it?  Oh myÂ When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
===
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
===
Ow!
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
===
Never done that before.
Nope.
===
 Hi!
 Hi! 
===
Monica? What time is it?
Uhh, 9. 
===
getting tired of sneaking around.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
===
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
===
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. 
===
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
===
Damn!
What's going on?
===
Hi!
Uh, hey!
===
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
===
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Aww, man! 
===
 Can you hear anything?
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
===
Ooh, 
Condoms?
===
may have to repopulate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
===
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
everywhere.
===
We're switching rooms.
 Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
===
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! 
===
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, great. 
===
 They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
===
We're switching rooms again.
What? Why?
===
 Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Uh-huh. 
===
Chandler!
 Yeah.
===
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
===
one I like!
 Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
===
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
===
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
===
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
===
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
===
What did you say?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
===
Hey, you're back!
Hey.
===
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
===
Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
===
Chandler! 
Monica. 
===
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Okay, fine, $300.
===
300 dollars?!
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
===
Hi, Rach.
Hi!
===
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
===
Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
===
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes that was mine.
===
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
===
Hi.
I just came over to drop offÂnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
===
Yeah, it did.
So, I guess this is over.
===
What?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
===
Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
===
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanÂOhhh! 
So, this isn't over?
===
 You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay. Great!
===
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! 
 We're in a relationship?
===
I'm afraid so.
Okay.
===
 Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second? 
===
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Yes. Yes. 
===
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
===
I guess I'm done.
Fun's over!
===
about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
===
Sorry.
Sorry.
===
Hey!
Hello!
===
would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!
===
her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
===
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said henceÂ
===
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. 
===
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
So you're really okay with this?
===
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
===
 I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. 
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
===
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks. 
===
Yeah!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
===
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! 
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
===
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. 
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
===
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
===
Hi Emily!
Hi!
===
She's there?!
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
===
No, look. 
That's a pig.
===
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
What?! 
===
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
===
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
===
What?
He thought you said gonad.
===
 Hey roomies!
Love what you've done with the place.
===
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tÂI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Oh yeah!
===
 You're fake laughing too, right?
Oh, the tears are real.
===
Hey.
What are you doing?
===
Nothing.
You built a fort didn't ya?
===
 Kinda.
 Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was 
===
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
this thing!
===
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Okay. 
===
is the deal with this? 
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
===
No, the quiet down thing!
You mean this. 
===
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Okay.
===
 Uh fellas, 
Okay, so he's out of here.
===
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Not even on page 7?
===
 Oh yeah! You'reÂhey, you're right! Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
What about that circled one?
===
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
===
Okay!
There we go!
===
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Let's go quicker.
===
Oh my God! 
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
===
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
===
 How about you?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
===
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Yes that was a nice place!
===
Yeah!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
===
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
You're kidding!
You're kidding, no!
===
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there  by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Yeah!
===
Definitely!
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
===
All right!
All right, buddy!
===
 Come on, it's fun!
All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?
===
That's very nice.
That's sweet, Joey.
===
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
===
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
===
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
===
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
===
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
like it sounds.
===
 It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
I'm over here big guy.
===
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
===
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
 Okay.
===
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
===
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
===
So IÂm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Emotional Knapsack?
===
Yeah.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, donÂt take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
===
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, IÂm gonna be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that too me!
===
Well, I do.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
===
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
===
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
===
 God, your hair sure is different!
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. 
===
Hi, Chandler.
Oh my God!
===
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? 
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
===
Dude!
Sorry!
===
Dude!
Sorry.
===
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey, what's up? 
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
===
Umm, I'd love too!  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay.
===
Boy, I love carrots! Oh!  Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you.  Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm,  my body. 
Are you all right?
===
You brought a carrot.
What?
===
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
===
to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
===
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. 
===
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. 
===
Wait, wait, wait! 
Look, MonicaÂ
===
Look! 
This is not going to work.
===
I bet this will work! 
You are so great! I love you!
===
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
===
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
===
Yes, you did!
No I didn't!
===
You love me!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
===
What am I sitting on?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay?  I'm out.
===
Well, they're not mine!
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
===
Yeah, they're mine.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
===
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Yeah!
===
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can'tÂ
 All this lying has been hard on us too.
===
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Well, yeah actually.
===
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
===
We are! Help us!
Help!
===
Hey, Phoebe!
Hi, Pheebs!
===
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Well, what did the police say?
===
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
===
Joey, is what she just said ummÂOh my God.  You were actually gonnaÂ  
What is going on here?
===
We're so sorry.
Yeah.
===
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. 
in this picture!
===
On account of my rage.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
===
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?
===
Joey has got a secret peephole!
 Oh no! No! No! No! 
===
a pervert! Okay? It's justÂ I justÂ KindaÂ
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
===
Thank you!
Joey's a sex addict. 
===
 I slept with Monica.
Well let'sÂ.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
===
My God Monica!!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
===
Hey, how do you spell suspicious? 
Why?
===
You're driving me crazy with that!
Okay, I'll stop.
===
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
===
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
===
 All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued. 
===
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. 
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
===
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
===
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
 Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidÂOp! Op! 
===
 I didn't finish my five pages.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
===
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
 Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
===
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
===
am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
===
How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
I paid for those tickets!
===
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Oh yeah! 
===
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?!
===
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureÂI didn't have my camera!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
===
Oh, great!
Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
===
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
===
Yay!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!
===
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
===
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
All right. 
===
Hey man.
What is up?
===
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
over reacted.
===
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interestÂ  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
more sorry. 
===
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  All right Joey, we get it.  I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry too.
===
 I am sorry, Chandler.
I am sorry, Ross.
===
A handsome man enters.  Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You,  you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you  well you co-created Fireball. The end.
This took you all day?!
===
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
 We're very happy for you.
===
What's the matter?!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'knowÂ
===
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
===
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
===
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now!
===
I just asked that girl out.
Nice!
===
Yes it is. See. 
 Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
===
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Horn-swoggle.
===
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. 
===
Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.   So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. 
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
===
Auntie Monica!! 
 Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?  Someone comment on the pants!
===
I like them a lot.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.
===
 I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
 Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? 
===
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
===
 What? Oh!
Sorry man.
===
Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
===
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
===
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I know, I can do this. 
===
Hey Bing!   Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh,  this is Monica.  This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
===
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
No, sir.
===
What was that?
What?
===
That noise you just made?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
===
Really? Your work laugh?
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
===
All right, check me out.
Okay.
===
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks atÂbigger rocks.  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
===
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Okay, good luck with that. 
===
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
===
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
===
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
You're not even giving them a chance!
===
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?   Please let them win!
===
I can't believe you let them win!
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. 
===
I was frustrated.
It was my racquet.
===
I was frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
===
Y'know what really bothers me? IsÂit's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"  I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
===
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Just a little bit of sugar.
===
 How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Oh, you get used to it.
===
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
===
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh. 
===
 Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.  Did you hear what I said Bing?
What?
===
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
===
Excuse me?
Well, I justÂ
===
 Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Really?
===
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
I think I do!  Thank you, Monica.
===
I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight! 
===
Sorry! I'm justÂI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
===
Dude, we got to talk.
Okay.
===
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice.  What you're-you're not mad?
Why would I be mad?
===
Okay.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
===
All right.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it downÂlet's write it down!
===
That was a half an hour?
It's your timer.
===
It's so good, isn't it?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
===
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Good-bye muscles!!
===
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
===
Sorry.
 And the bunny got away. 
===
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
===
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Hey.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Thanks!
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
===
That was my dad!
Oh my God!
===
No he's not!
 Yes, he is!
===
What?!
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
===
No.
 Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
===
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell meÂjust say, "I don't like your massages."
 I don't like your massages.
===
 See? It's no big deal.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
===
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
What?
===
 My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
===
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
===
I'm crying here!!
bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
===
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
===
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely!
===
Okay. I suck!
Yeah! 
===
Hey!
Hey man, how did the audition go?
===
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
Oh my God!
===
Honey wait, Joey, IÂm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with itÂ 
Oh, hey! 
===
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldnÂt have a bag, I justÂit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
===
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
===
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
telephone thing.
===
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
 Hello children!
===
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Really?
===
 Yeah the material feels so softÂhello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things.  Are you okay?
===
Well, if you really wanna know, I'mÂOh! I can't tell you this.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
===
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
===
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
===
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
===
What?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
===
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
===
That's not possible!
Ow!
===
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
===
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
===
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
===
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
===
No.
That new mountain bike?
===
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad.
===
Bye Chandler!   I miss you already. 
 Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
===
Actually, I did!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
===
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Are you serious?
===
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
 Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsÂShe knows!
===
Yeah?
Phoebe knows about us!
===
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh man!
===
messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! SoÂ
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
===
 Oh?  Hello you.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. 
===
Eh?
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
===
Really?
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
===
 Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
===
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
 Really?
===
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Yes.
===
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
===
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
How do you know?!
===
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
At this?!
===
Chandler.
Come on in.
===
I was going too.  Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Sure.
===
So, here we are. Nervous?
Me? No. You?
===
No, I want this to happen.
So do I.
===
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. 
You look good.
===
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
===
Really?
Oh, do you not want to?
===
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
 Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
===
She's bluffing!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! 
===
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
===
Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.
 It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
===
You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
===
Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
===
And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
===
Dude!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
===
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
===
Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
 Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! 
===
What are you doing?!
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
===
 Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Ross knows about me and Monica.
===
 I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
===
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kidsÂ
 Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
===
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
===
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
===
Âso then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
 Sounds like a fun party.
===
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
===
realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Wh-wh-why?!
===
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
===
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
===
Isn't this great?
Hmm.
===
Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. 
===
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
===
What-what are you doing?
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
===
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
What?!
===
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
want all that stuff, right?
===
know what I want!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
===
I do not have baby fever!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
===
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
===
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! 
Well, I did not know that.
===
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me?
===
Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?
Monica. 
===
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
===
What?!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
===
 I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
===
Okay.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. 
===
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
 MonicaÂ
===
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Will you marry me?
===
Chandler, why are you doing this?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
===
Chandler.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
===
 Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how 
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
===
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. 
===
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
I didn't think I was!
===
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. 
===
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
===
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? 
That's not funny.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
What are you guys doing up?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
===
 Dark red.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?
===
Wow!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
===
 Hey, you guys!
Hey!
===
What's with him?
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
===
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
===
 Hey!  Oh.
Hi, Joe.
===
Nothing!
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
===
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it. 
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I donÂt want to talk about it.
===
Well, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream? 
===
No!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
===
Um-hmm.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
===
 Not really.
Well there you have it!
===
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
===
 Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
===
Well, I brought the next best thing.
 Hey!
===
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, soÂ
===
No! That's-that's my arm!
 Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
===
Okay!
Okay.
===
All right, ready?
Yeah.
===
Turn.
 Okay.
===
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
===
a sketch!
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
===
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. 
 Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
===
 All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
===
okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
 Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
===
No!
So what happened?
===
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
===
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.
===
No, in Ross's building!  She's back! She's back!  Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.  Got it! 
I gotta check out this hot girl!  There she is! 
===
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would youÂ 
===
Okay.  Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Uh, yeah.
===
to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Why?
===
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Ohh, so?
===
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
===
gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
===
is hotter than we are! You're the best.
No, you're the best.
===
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
===
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
===
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Oh yeah, it's so cool.  Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100.  That's pee-pee. 
===
Hi Chandler.
Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?
===
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
===
let them win!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
===
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
 So?
===
I feel really sad that we're notÂreally there anymore.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
===
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
===
Really?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. 
===
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Yeah?
===
Yeah. 
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
===
Did not.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
===
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
 You guys ready fore the movies?
===
Okay, pick a card.
Okay. 
===
All right now, memorize it.  You got it?
Oh yes.
===
 Is that your card? 
 Yes. 
===
Hi!
Hi there!
===
on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
That.
===
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very 
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
===
They're gonna do it together.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
===
Yeah.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out? 
===
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Yeah, it is the best.
===
Yeah, I can do that.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
===
Oh good!
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
===
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
===
Umm, cups.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
===
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna 
Y'know I rued the day onceÂdidn't get a whole lot else done.
===
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
 Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one. 
===
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
===
I did not!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
===
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
I wish I had smoked for my careerÂ
===
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
===
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. 
I think you smell great! 
===
 Check it out! Cup hat!  Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! 
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
===
 And did you notice the ice?  Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch!  Ahhh! Mystical!
Awesome!
===
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
There are snow cones!  Snow cones! Yuck!
===
Y'knowÂgo! Go! Right there! 
Thank you! Thank you! 
===
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Okay, great.
===
 So we talked about the  whole presentation yesterday at lunch  and he wondered if one person would be enough  to get a take on the trip  and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!" 
I'll catch you guys later. 
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
===
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert. 
===
Hi Chandler!
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
===
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
more interesting.
===
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Oh, okay.  Here you go. 
===
Hey, where's the chicken?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
===
 Great. I'll see you later!
Okay, bye!
===
What the hell was that?!
What?
===
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
I was not flirting.
===
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
===
Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. 
===
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
I was not and oh God, shh!
===
WellÂ
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
===
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.  I've done it again.
===
 Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Happy Anniversary, 10 months! 
===
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in LondonÂ
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. 
===
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
The one that doesn't.
===
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
===
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Okay.
===
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
===
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Here you go.  Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
===
I'm gonna try. 
You're welcome.
===
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
What?
===
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Thank you for that!  I was not flirting.
===
Really?!
Really?!
===
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
 So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
===
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
hotter than I am.
===
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
===
 Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
 Well, what is it?
===
 Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
 If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
===
Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
===
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
===
No way!
It's true.
===
Well that's pathetic!
Again true.
===
And this goes for all guys?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
===
Joey!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you're old and small.
===
 Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!  Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Okay, hold on.  Okay. 
===
Gas? Wow! Intense.
 If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
===
A lot of other gas smellsÂ
Oh the humanity.
===
 Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
===
 Hey! Is the show still on?
Almost over man.
===
 Look! Oh!  Is that the Pope?! 
Why am I looking?
===
That's right!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
===
Hi!
You ready?
===
Yeah.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
===
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Let me see the earrings.
===
Oh, honey, the earringsÂ
 They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
===
Okay!
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
===
Really?! You?
Yeah.
===
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Well, I like danger.
===
Yeah!!
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
===
 That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
It is starting to get dark out there.
===
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
 Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.
===
 Yeah okay.  Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
tax dollars?
===
Did I say you could smell it?!
I can't smell your sandwich?
===
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
===
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Okay.
===
Are you thinking about Monica?
Yeah.
===
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
===
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
How do you figure that?
===
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
===
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
 Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
===
Is everything okay?
What's going on?
===
My God, Joey!
 It was a car backfire!
===
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Who jumps at loud noises!
===
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. 
===
for 
 Oh my God! 
===
Dude! How come you took off? 
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. WhateverÂ
===
Is something wrong?
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
===
Okay.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
===
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
===
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
What picture?
===
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
===
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! IÂknewÂyou could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
===
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet!
===
I know it doesn't make much senseÂ
sense?!
===
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
===
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
===
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Really?!
===
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.
Thanks. 
===
How good is that?
 Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
===
See?
Hm-hmm. 
===
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
===
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
===
I'm fine, thanks.
 Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
===
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Okay.
===
I can't believe this!
 Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
===
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! 
===
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
So, what are you gonna do?
===
I don't know. I'll just handle itÂI'll ask you to talk to him!
Me?! Why me?
===
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him aÂman!
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
===
That is so sweet! 
 Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. 
===
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
===
Yeah?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
===
 What's up?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
===
Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
===
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
===
No, I mean happy.
Scared? Happy?
===
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
===
I know! I can't wait!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
===
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I justÂI wanna be around her as much as I can.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
===
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
===
No, it's too soon for you guys.
 Yeah, you're right about that.
===
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
===
What?!
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
===
thing you can do! The 
IÂm sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
===
Hey Chandler.
Hey Gar!
===
 Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
===
That's right baby.
All right, let me in. 
===
 No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
What?
===
Oh yeah, that's right!
I'm not a dropper!
===
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
It's throwing and catching!
===
All right. 
Oh! Oh! That's so hard. 
===
I tried! They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
===
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
===
Please! I made this game what it is.
Not fun anymore?
===
What?!
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
===
He shot a bird!
Oh that is over!
===
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
===
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
===
Oh God, here we go!
What?
===
 I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Wow umm, calm down.
===
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
===
 Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what.  I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
===
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas!  And you know what that means buddy!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
===
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
===
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
===
Oh umm, not go.
All right, great, road trip baby!  This okay with you?
===
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission.  You can go.
Thank you.
===
Damn!
 Hey!
===
Hey! You ready to go?
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? 
===
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
===
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
===
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
===
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Okay!
===
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
===
Don't worry, it's out there!  I think I just need lunch.
Yeah.
===
You wanna eat?  My treat!
Isn't that Ross's money?
===
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
===
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Okay!
===
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Too dry.
===
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
No!
===
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
No!
===
 What?!
Yes.
===
Dude you said, "No!"
I also said, "Yes!"
===
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
No!  Ahhh!!!
===
I don't believe this!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
===
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
===
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
===
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
===
Not if you're gonna be like this!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
===
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
===
Fine!  Get out!
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
===
Get out!!
All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
===
Eh! Stop it!
 Hey!
===
Hey!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
===
Why?!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
===
That game should not be played without my supervision. 
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
===
What's in the bag?
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
===
Oh that's my grandma.  And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. 
 Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
===
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wonderingÂ  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
===
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of pornÂ
===
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Really?
===
 Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
 Is that Joey?!  Let me talk to him!
===
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
 Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
===
Yeah! 
 Hey!
===
On a totally different bet.
 Hey!
===
It's almost our anniversary!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
===
annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
===
I got you a present!
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
===
I know, but you have to open it today! 
Okay.
===
 Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Wow!
===
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Do we have to?
===
No.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
===
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
===
But we can go, right?
Yes.
===
Okay!
It's a great idea. 
===
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
 anniversary.
===
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
 Art lover!
===
What'd you say?
I said art lover.
===
Is that supposed to be an insult?
I don't know, I'm very tired. 
===
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
===
Okay, what about after I give you these candies? 
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
===
Ah-ha! Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. 
 Happy plane-aversary.
===
Aww! I love you!
Can I give you a present now?
===
Okay!
Okay!  Oh man! DonÂt tell me I did this!
===
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
===
Oh that's okay. DonÂt worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
===
 Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What-what Richard thing?
===
Oh no. [The patented version.]
What Richard thing?
===
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
 I'm not mad.
===
Really?!
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. 
===
For 99 cents, I'd eat you.  Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look!  Oh! Look! Hi!
Oh my God.
===
Hi!
Love your condoms my man.
===
They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why?! What happened?!
===
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya.  I'm sorry man.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
===
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
===
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Thanks. 
===
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
 Next time?
===
Ooh, so close.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
===
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
===
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Fine with me!
===
No it is not!
What are you talkingÂ
===
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Really?
===
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Whoa!
===
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! 
===
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
I see.
===
gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
 What?
===
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
===
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
===
DonÂt you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
 How?
===
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Again I must go back to, how?
===
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice? Huh?
 Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
===
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
===
lucky!  Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
No!
===
But she just came up here!
That was Joey!
===
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
===
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Really?
===
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Okay. 
===
All right baby, come on!  Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
 See you later Mon.
===
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
===
What? Wait! Why?  Chandler! Chandler! Wait! IÂm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Come on! I was there!  I know he's the love of your life.
===
Not any more.
Really?!
===
Really!  All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary.  Okay, this is empty.
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
===
 Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get! 
 Hey Pheebs!
===
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. 
===
 A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes!
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
===
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
===
job!
8. 8!
===
Thank you!
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
===
 We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Noo!
===
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
===
What?
Two fours.
===
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! 
 Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
===
Oh, that's because I had lunch with RichÂMe neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Another hard 8.
===
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight;  and we get married here tonight.
===
What did you just say?
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
===
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
===
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
===
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
===
Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
All right! 
===
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
===
You're so efficient. I love you! 
Let's go! 
===
No-no-no! We need something old!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
===
That'll work!
I don't think so.
===
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
 Here justÂtake this. 
===
That's stealing!
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
===
Ohh. 
Okay, one thing at a time. 
===
Whoa!
Oh my God!
===
 Hey! DonÂt you give me any of yourÂHey! 
Hey!
===
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! IsnÂt that why you guys are here?
Yes! Well that-yes.
===
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
We actually missed it.
===
WhatÂs the big deal, yÂknow? ItÂs not like itÂs a real marriage.
What?!
===
Hey.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
===
Where is the waitress?! IÂm starving!
ItÂs a buffet man.
===
Oh, hereÂs where I win all my money back! 
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
===
Sure! WhatÂs up? 
Monica and I almost got married last night.
===
Oh my God! ThatÂs huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasnÂt invited? And who was going to be your best man? DonÂt say, "Ross." Do 
Look, I just donÂt think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! YÂknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. YÂknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
===
Oh! Tell her sheÂs not marriage material.
What?!
===
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
 Hi.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
What?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? OrÂ
===
 Who got married?! 
 You did.
===
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? 
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this oneÂs free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third oneÂs free.
===
think we should do?
I donÂt know. But I-I-I know I love you!
===
I know I love you! 
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
===
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we donÂt get married.
Sounds great.
===
Ready?
Ready!
===
 Come on eight.
 Yes, yes eight.
===
Wow! I canÂt believe I actually rolled an eight.
unlikely. Well, letÂs get married! I guess.
===
Wait a minute. That wasnÂt a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
ThatÂs right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
===
I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?
Yeah.  WeÂre doing the right thing, right?
===
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Well you did pull his hair.
===
He took my snack!
IÂm not getting into this again!
===
This doesnÂt mean anything, does it?
No!
===
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. 
All right, should we just, should we just get married? YÂknow? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
===
IÂm sick of the signs! ItÂs too fast, IÂm happy the way things are!
Me too!
===
I donÂt want things to change! Do you?
No!
===
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because itÂs been three days and itÂs driving me insane!
Jeez, relax! ItÂs not like weÂre mar-ah-ah!! 
===
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
===
Then youÂd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnÂt make any sense.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂm saying?
===
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
===

Okay!!!!!
===
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Okay.
===
HereÂs your key 
Oh thanks.
===
HereÂs your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
The door hasnÂt been locked in five years, but okay!  Ready?!
===
Wait! Oh my God! I canÂt get out!
This is not a sign!
===
No, itÂs not a sign! ItÂs a very old key!
ItÂs an old key!
===
Oh my God itÂs old!
I love you!
===
I love you!
Are you hugging the door right now.
===
No.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
===
What are you doing?
The keyÂs stuck in the lock.
===
I can fix it. Hold on.  Look out. Look out. 
 It still doesnÂt work.
===
IÂm not finished.
Oh.
===
Of course! Joey wouldnÂt let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, heÂs surprisingly strict.
===
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youÂre moving out? 
No, no, I keep trying, yÂknow? I can get out, "Joey, I have tooÂ" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "Âgo to the bathroom." He may think IÂm sick.
===
YÂknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but IÂ We just have to get it over with! YÂknow, the next time we see them weÂre just gonna tell them. Okay? ThatÂs it.
Oh, so thatÂs this is gonna work now? YouÂre just gonna order me around all the time?
===
Pretty much.
All right.
===
Oh my God! YouÂre pregnant!
No-o-o!  No?  No-o-o! Look Joey, hereÂs the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, IÂm gonna be moving out man.
===
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like youÂd believe that. This sucks!
Look, I-IÂm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up IÂm moving right back in with you!
===
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
 What gave me away?
===
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and sheÂs the only one left!
Okay, so thatÂs it, everybody knows! ItÂs official, weÂre moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
===
No.
Wow that was my scariest voice! YouÂre very brave.
===
Hey!
Hey.
===
Ugh, the worse day! YÂknow, you think youÂre making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.
===
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Well, I-I still think youÂre very-very nice and very prettyÂ
===
What?
 All yours babe. 
===
And Chandler, youÂre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel canÂt be late.
RachÂ
===
Soon! I-I just couldnÂt before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldnÂt do that to her, sheÂs my best friend!
Well, JoeyÂs my best friend.
===
IÂm not your best friend?
You just saidÂ Of course youÂre my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
===
All right, all right, at least IÂm prepared.
Okay.  Oh yes. 
===
 Hey!
Hey-hey!
===
These arenÂt for you! Are you upset?
I am now!
===
 Hey roomie!
Okay, bye! 
===
God, itÂs gonna so weird like when I come home and youÂre not here. YÂknow? No more Joey and ChanÂs. No more J and CÂs. "You wanna go over to Joey and ChandlerÂs?" "CanÂt, its not there."
Look, IÂm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
===
Yeah but we wonÂt be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
===
 Hi.
Hey!
===
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Oh yeah? Well, howÂd she take it?
===
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnÂt cry. She wasnÂt angry or sad. 
And youÂre upset because you didnÂt make your best friend cry?
===
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! ItÂs like the end of an era! No more J-man and ChannieÂs!! 
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
===
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Pheebs, I donÂt understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
===
Yeah, yeah I think IÂm gonna find my own place.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked ThursdayÂs was just our thing man!
===
Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.
Who was it?
===
Okay listen, yÂknow when you move in RachelÂs room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Sure!
===
No.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. LetÂs discuss it before we reject it completely."
===
Oh, IÂm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
So, thatÂs it?
===
I just donÂt think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
is perfect! ItÂs the oldest game!
===
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I donÂt have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
===
Are you mocking me?
No, IÂm not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room. 
===
Hey, whatÂs up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
===
But youÂre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. 
 "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
===
Stop it Chandler.  IÂm sorry too.
Really?
===
Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh.
===
Listen, we donÂt have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
===
Oh good.
Hey, yÂknow what? Why donÂt we think about changes we can make in the living room?
===
Changes?
Yeah, I mean weÂre gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. 
===
YouÂre-youÂre-youÂre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Is that a problem?
===
Well, itÂs a set and they should probably stay together.
Oh, thatÂs cool. Then IÂll just bring them both over.
===
See now-now youÂre taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! IÂll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
===
Yeah-yeah, yÂknow what? Yeah, thatÂs it-thatÂs it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! ThatÂs-thatÂs what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! IÂm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnÂt match! Where is it gonna go?!
In the game room!
===
my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
All right! ThatÂs fine! ThatÂs fine! I wonÂt bring over the chairs! I wonÂt bring anything over! I wouldnÂt want to ruin the ambiance over here at GrandmaÂs place!! 
===
Whoa!! Now look, donÂt be just blurtinÂ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
 You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! IÂll be living here. 
===
Oh donÂt listen to him, heÂs just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I donÂt think heÂs gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
===
Well, apparently not, and I canÂt just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Well, why donÂt you tell her to stop being silly! 
===
 Okay-okay! Two very good points, look IÂve known you both a long time, and IÂve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youÂve been since youÂve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
===
Love is the best medicine.
ThatÂs laughter.
===
Why do you do it?
I donÂt know.
===
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Yeah, I do.
===
ThatÂs very funny!
HeÂs being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
===
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnÂt about the room, this is about what the roomÂrepresents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
===
You still want to move in together right?
Of course!
===
Ross didnÂt scare you?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
===
Come here, I want to show you something!
Okay!
===
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and itÂs still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh thatÂs so sweet! I want to show you something too!
===
Okay!
YÂknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
===
Uh-hmm.
YÂknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thatÂs you and I together! Merge!
===
Oh my God! I love that!
Really?!
===
Hey!
Oh, whatÂs the matter?
===
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Yeah?
===
Well, she told me that IÂm gonna die this week, so IÂm kinda bummed about that.
What?!
===
I donÂtÂshe said yÂknow that IÂd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youÂre gonna go?
===
 Hey everyone!
Oh hi!
===
Ohh! Okay! Okay.  "There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  intoÂ"
Why donÂt you open with a joke?
===
Open with a joke? ItÂs a university, not a comedy club!
talking about Chuckles University?!
===
I-I-I donÂt even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. YÂknow what? IÂm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
ThatÂs the way I did it Âtil I was 19.
===
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen ActorÂs Guild.
===
Ooh, itÂs probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, IÂm kindaÂ.
 "Benefits lapsed."
===
Hmm thatÂs weird. I donÂt remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, itÂs not a check. TheyÂre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnÂt work enough last year.
===
Let me see that!
All right.
===
 Oh, I canÂt believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yÂknow? And it wouldnÂt matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
IÂm sorry man, thereÂs never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
===
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. IÂm gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
===
 Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and IÂll have my health insurance back in no time.
ThatÂs great, but shouldnÂt you be on the toilet right now?
===
What?!
WhatÂs wrong with you?
===
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havenÂt been able to stand up since. But um, I donÂt think itÂs anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have toÂyou-you go to the doctor!
===
No way! ÂKay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything itÂs gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! 
ThatÂs a hernia.
===
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides itÂs getting darker and more painful, that means itÂs healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and letÂs just get that thingÂpushed back in.
===
Hey!
Hey.
===
WhatÂs going on?
Oh JoeyÂs got a really bad hernia, but thatÂs nothing a little laser eye surgery wonÂt fix!
===
 Thank you.
But are you sure you can do this?
===
Hey-hey-hey!
What are you doing?
===
WeÂre just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Oh, all right.
===
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didnÂt get the annulment; we are still married.
What?
===
Okay, maybe it wasnÂt my best decision. But I just couldnÂt face another failed marriage.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
===
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youÂre not married to anymore of us are ya?
===
ThereÂs a lost and found?  My shoe! 
You left a shoe here?!
===
Well, I didnÂt realize until I got home. I wasnÂt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! YÂknow what? IÂm gonna go find that guyÂs car and leave a note on the windshield. 
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, IÂll be sure to give him your shoe.
===
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
 Yeah, all right.
===
Okay, well IÂll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, theyÂre not actually puppies, theyÂre Frank and AliceÂs triplets. Okay, see ya! 
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
===
DonÂt worry about it Phoebe, weÂll absolutely do it.
Yeah, IÂm gonna pass. ÂCause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
===
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, itÂs going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When youÂre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. 
===
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
See thatÂs where I think that youÂre wrong. WeÂve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
===
What do you mean?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yÂknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands aroundÂ 
===
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Okay, IÂm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
===
 Hey guys!
Hey!
===
Hey babies! Oh, IÂm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche IÂve got the keys too, still there!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
===
You should see the treatment I get when IÂm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
What equity investments?
===
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
You donÂt even have a car!
===
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
And?
===
And six others.
There you are.
===
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thatÂs the same.
 Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! 
===
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someoneÂs eye out!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
===
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, thatÂs just gonna mess them up.
TheyÂre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
===
What?!
Glass, sand, whatever. 
===
How are you still single?!
 All right.  I thought about it and maybe youÂre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
===
Good. What made you change your mind?
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
===
How did that happen?!!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. YÂknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now itÂs lodged in my throat.  
===
 So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
===
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnÂt have the car! Right?
That is true.
===
Come on! What are you doing?! IÂm in character! Would you talk to her! 
Ahh, I think it just moved. ItÂs really poking me.
===
But no, because a doctor wonÂt be able to help him, itÂs just gonna yÂknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
I think thatÂs gum.
===
IÂm pretty sure itÂs gun.
Okay, listen this really hurts. LetÂs go.
===
 How do you feel?
Well, letÂs just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
===
took care of the babies all by myself! I fed Âem, bathed Âem, and put Âem to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?
===
But my apartment!
Was the setting of PhoebeÂs triumph.
===
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
===
YouÂre right, youÂre right I shouldnÂt freak out. ÂCause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
 Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
===
Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.
===
And thatÂs every month?
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
===
Ahhh.
Okay, here is the phone bill. 
===
 Oh my God!!
ThatÂs our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why donÂt I justÂwhy donÂt I just cover you for a while?
===
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityÂanymore.
ItÂs not charity, JoeÂ
===
No! Forget it! OkayÂI mean thanks, but IÂm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whatÂs next? Come on.
Okay uh, hereÂs the electric bill. 
===
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Uh, yeah.
===
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnÂt take it.
===
Well, how much do you think he needs?
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yÂknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wonÂt hurt his pride.
===
Why donÂt you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Well that would help the pride thing.
===
 Hey!
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
===
 Okay.
Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure weÂd do nothing.
===
 Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, weÂre gonna start withÂ
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
===
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Yes, but for the last time.
===
ItÂs almost 8 oÂclock, itÂs almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
HeÂs at a dinner party.
===
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh, I wish IÂd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
===
What, are you crazy? You havenÂt beaten me once since my injury plagued Â97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
===
Okay, youÂre on.
Okay, letÂs play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
===
 Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! ThatÂs like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  Whoo-ho-ho!  I gotta buy some food.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
===
You serious?
Oh yes!
===
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Okay.
===
This sucks man! The last night youÂre here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? 
===
Nah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about, how aboutÂyÂknow what? We could play a new game. A new game, itÂs fun.
===
Well, whatÂs it called?
Cups.
===
I donÂt know how to play Cups.
IÂll teach ya! Come on, come on, itÂs really easy and really, really fun.
===
All right.
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
===
A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
===
Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, letÂs play again.  What do you got?
===
A four and a nine.
YouÂre kidding right?
===
No. Why?
Well thatÂs a full cup! 
===
Well, what did you have?
It doesnÂt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
===
Uh,  wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?
===
Yeah.
Double it! 
===
What?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
===
Really?
Hey, I didnÂt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  DonÂt get to excited because thatÂs not gonna happen unless you getÂNo way! 
===
Hey!
WhatÂs wrong?
===
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
===
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the SittinÂ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnÂt even get half a cup! NothinÂ!!
Oh man!!
===
And he never played before either! YÂknow what I think? I think beginnerÂs luck, 
All right, letÂs play one more hand! One more!
===
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! IÂm serious this time! In-in fact, look, thereÂs aÂI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yÂknow, thank you for being such a great roommate.
I canÂt take the big white dog! You love it!
===
ItÂs him, not it!
No, but waitÂwhat if I bought it from you, yÂknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?
===
Wait a second, I see what youÂre trying to do here! You-youÂre trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
===
Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
IÂm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youÂre okay.
===
She really left.
I know. 
===
Thank you.
No problem roomie. 
===
Can I ask you a question?
Sure!
===
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
===
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? 
ItÂs not a real game! I made it up!
===
IÂm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!!
===
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, IÂd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am 
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
===
No.
Hmm, letÂs see if it comes up this time. 
===
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
 And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
===
 Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
===
move them!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. 
===
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
===
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable
===
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Hey, look at all the boxes!
===
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
===
Oh God, yeah.
at the supermarket.
===
 Okay!
No-no
===
 I Gotcha!!
 Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
===
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, MonicaÂs gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
===
 I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
===
start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what Âcha doin?
am cleaning!
===
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
===
ÂKay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
===
Monica?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
===
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
===
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakÂout. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.
===
 Hi!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
===
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. 
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
===
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
===
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
===
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
===
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
===
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
===
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that. 
===
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.
===
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
===
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
===
 What?!
 I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
===
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
===
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Bye! Thank God
===
Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
===
 The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect! That's brilliant! 
===
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Uh-huh
===
Bye! 
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. 
===
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
===
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? 
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
===
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
===
Of course!
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
===
Yeah, I gotta go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
===
 Okay, great!Â  Bye.  So guess whoÂs coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
===
 I miss Rachel.  No, my parents.
Oh! ThatÂs great, they havenÂt seen the place since I moved in!
===
Because they donÂt know weÂre dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? 
Why havenÂt you told them?!
===
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didnÂt.
Why havenÂt you told them?! WouldnÂt they be happy?!
===
 So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! IÂll see you then. 
Why wouldnÂt they be happy?
===
Well, um, because mainly, um, they donÂt like you. IÂm sorry.
What? What? Why?!
===
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youÂre really sarcastic, or that, yÂknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Is this why they donÂt like me or why you donÂt like me?
===
Look, I know that I shouldÂve told them. I know I shouldnÂt care what they think. IÂm sorry. 
YÂknow, itÂll be okay. ItÂll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then weÂll tell Âem.
===
You really think thatÂll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnÂt I?
===
 Yes, of course they like you!
Well Monica just told me that they donÂt.
===
 Yeah, they donÂt like you.
 Do you know why?
===
I dunno, maybe itÂs because youÂre really sarcastic. Or maybe itÂs cause you uh-
 Well if people donÂt know they shouldnÂt just guess!
===
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttinÂ up, eh?
over to my new apartment.
===
Well maybe I love yaÂ.
[mocks that last comment].
===
 Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
===
YÂknow dad, Chandler is one of RossÂs very best friends!
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yÂknow IÂve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
===
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Oh, yes. Well itÂs very beautiful. ItÂs cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I donÂt mean tight, I mean itÂs not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
===
 I think heÂs stoned again.
 What?
===
Okay, I think I might know why my parents donÂt like you.
You do? Why?
===
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
What?! Why did you do that?
===
I donÂt know, aheh, yourÂs was the first name that-that popped into my head, IÂm IÂm sorry. I-I didnÂt think it would matter.
How could it not matter?!
===
How was I supposed to know weÂd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
What about all that Âfriends foreverÂ stuff?
===
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
===
Ross, I canÂt believe youÂd do that!
The reason we havenÂt told them weÂre together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
===
Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying ÂmmmÂ and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Yeah, IÂm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
===
 Mmm.
 Yeah, this is so good, that IÂm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
===
No! Thank you!  Monica, and Ross! I donÂt know what IÂm gonna do about the two of you!
 IÂll talk to them! 
===
Hey you guys.
Hey Joe whatÂs up?
===
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. YÂknow, everywhere I look sheÂs likeÂ 
I can see why thatÂs hard to resist.
===
I know. And sheÂs so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
You are aware that sheÂs not a monkey, right?
===
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Ah, youÂre still just a little fat girl inside arenÂt you? 
===
Did she just ask me out on a date?
I donÂt think so.
===
Oh my God!
God!
===
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I can save you time ladies, IÂm right here.
===
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
What? ThatÂs terrible!
===
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
===
DonÂt worry, weÂre just gonna search here for an hour, them weÂre gonna go over to JoeyÂs and search, OK?
No not okay, you canÂt look for MonicaÂs presents!
===
But we have to!
No, you donÂt have to, and you canÂt because I live here too.
===
Well then, you should look with us.
Why?
===
Chandler, arenÂt you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
===
Chandler, thatÂs not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youÂve just gotten her one great present? I mean thatÂs just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
If I help, we can find Âem faster!
===
We are so gonna find them this year.
YÂknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you donÂt, you donÂt do that every year do you?
===
Yeah.
You donÂt, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
===
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
===
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
===
Ha!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
===
Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
===
YÂknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
===
Or we could just follow your clever jokes Â any ideas? No! DidnÂt think so! Okay, cÂmon guys, show us where the presents are!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thatÂs as good as garbage?
===
No, donÂt look directly at them!
What?
===
Oh, this oneÂs for Chandler. Here.
Oh great!
===
Ooh, letÂs open them!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
===
Hee hee!
Wait, we canÂt do this.
===
Why?
I donÂt wanna know what Monica got me. YÂknow? I mean, look, IÂm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
===
Whatever Linus, IÂm opening mine.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I donÂt know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on MonicaÂs face when I give her my present, and IÂm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
===
Will you get us better gifts?
Fine!
===
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
ThatÂs what you got me?
===
I canÂt do it! 
Now you do that, youÂre on TV.
===
You serious?!
ThatÂs great!
===
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
===
I came over here to tell you guys.
So sheÂs just waiting over there for ya?
===
I know.
to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. 
===
Yeah! ItÂs an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
A pharmacist. 
===
too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
===
Hey! I made that for her!
You made pottery?
===
Okay fine! IÂll-IÂll just tell her itÂs an antique apothecary table, she doesnÂt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yoreÂ
===
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Look at us, weÂre a couple of couples!
===
Nope-op! I insist!  You get the wine right?
Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.
===
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnÂt afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
===
Oh, sheÂs uh-uh really sick.
Oh thatÂs too bad.
===
Bye. 
ThatÂs funny, I saw no phlegm.
===
No-no, she really is sick!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
===
Well uh, she didnÂt want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. IÂm so sorry.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
===
 What?!!  What?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
===
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
===
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, donÂt-donÂt be mad. IÂm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! YÂknow? And it was our first date! Plus, sheÂs really sick!
No, you shÂNo you said you made that up!!
===
I know, but donÂt you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Eh, theyÂre both good. I generally just go with, MonicaÂs drunk again.  
===
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Okay.
===
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Perfect decibel.
===
 Hey!
Hey.
===
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Oh nothing, weÂre just talking. YÂknow, blah-blah-blah.
===
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, IÂve got to say, IÂm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
ThatÂs totally understandable.
===
So we can go out again?
Oh yeah!
===
it!! YÂknow, youÂre not so quiet yourself, missy!
And IÂm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
===
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!  You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! 
 YÂknow I think you can take her.
===
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, IÂm sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
===
How ya doinÂ?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
===
Well, when itÂs not right, you know it.
You okay?
===
What?
I made that joke up.
===
Uh, oh-oh, no you didnÂt. I did.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke heÂd ever heard.
===
IÂm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. 
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
===
No.
Seriously?
===
Look, Chandler, itÂs my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they donÂt print the name, so it doesnÂt really matter who gets credit, right?
Yeah, I guess.
===
No, itÂs my joke, itÂs mine. You can call them, theyÂll tell you.
ItÂs my joke.
===
LetÂs go watch it at your place.
Nah, MonicaÂs watching some cooking show. Come on, I donÂt want to miss when they were skinny.
===
Chandler, Chandler, yÂknow what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
===
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havenÂt really paid the bill
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
===
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. 
Whoa ho.
===
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the 
 All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
===
Sure.
 Paid your phone bill?
===
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Yeah.
===
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
===
Your joke? Well, I think Âthe HefÂ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
===
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think IÂll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
===
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Yeah!
===
Well, IÂm not going to go now anyway .
Okay .
===
 She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
 He took my joke, he took it. 
===
ItÂs wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? IÂm going to get a joke journal. YÂknow? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
===
ThatÂs a good idea. 
Yeah!
===
Do you know whatÂs a bad idea?
Picking Rachel.
===
ThatÂs right.  Did you hear something?
Maybe itÂs the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
===
ItÂs kind of embarrassing, yÂknow. I mean, I was an actor and now IÂm a waiter. ItÂs supposed to go in the other direction.
So is your apron. YouÂre wearing it like a cape.
===
See, now itÂs weird again.
I think itÂs great that you work here. YouÂre going to make a lot of money, and hereÂs your first tip: DonÂt eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
===
ItÂs my joke.
ItÂs my joke.
===
YÂknow, I donÂt think weÂre going to settle this.
LetÂs have Monica decide.
===
Yeah!
Yeah!
===
Hey Mon.
Mon, get out here!
===
Monica! 
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
===
Why do I have to decide?
Because youÂre the only one that can be fair.
===
Yeah, but IÂm your brother. WeÂre family. ThatÂs the most important thing in the world.
 DonÂt try to sway her.   IÂm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, letÂs go.
===
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
===
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Can I finish my story?!
===
Continue.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And SteveÂs doctorÂs name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ÂDoctor Monkey?Â And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. 
===
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, IÂm a doctor, and I had a monkey. IÂm Doctor Monkey!
IÂm not arguing with that.
===
ItÂs your joke.
Is not.
===
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Hi, oh hi.
===
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
 IÂm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
===
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
 YouÂre a little high maintenance.
===
are on my list.
IÂm sorry. YouÂre not easy-going, but youÂre passionate, and thatÂs good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that IÂm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thatÂs good too. So, they can say that youÂre high maintenance, but itÂs okay, because I like Â maintaining you.
===
  I didnÂt even tell him to say that. . All right youÂre off my list. 
 IÂm off the list.  
===
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together thatÂs  $12.75.
This coming from the man who couldnÂt split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
===
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here? ShouldnÂt you be at work?
===
 I have not been sick in over three years!  
IÂm gonna grab you some tissue.
===
Yeah but it wasnÂt for me, it was for a friend.
make friends with the wrong sister! 
===
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? LetÂs do something crazy!
I know, letÂs rest and drink lots of fluids. 
===
Okay, IÂll rest. But yÂknow if IÂm going to bed, then youÂre coming with me.
That would be impossible to resist if you werenÂt all drippy here. 
===
 Are you saying that you donÂt wanna get with this? 
Yeah, I donÂt you should say that even when youÂre healthy.
===
 Come on. 
DonÂt take this personally okay? ItÂs just that I just canÂt have sex with a sick person.
===
IÂm with you Chandler! I mean I canÂt have sex with a sick person either, thatÂs disgusting! But IÂm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
ThatÂs the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
===
 Chandler!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup?  Oh-ohhhh!
===
 Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
===
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! YÂknow whatÂs sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
===
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that IÂm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.  
Would you please get some rest!
===
 Chandler, I think IÂm sick.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
===
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? (She hands him some of that 
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
===
Come on! I really need your help!
No-no-no-no-no!
===
Fine, IÂll rub it on myself.
Okay.
===
Yeah?
ItÂs nice.
===
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Yes! 
===
I canÂt believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
ItÂs all very, very good.  So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
===
Not now, IÂm sick!
Oh come on you big faker!
===
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
===
Okay, if you really wanna have sexÂ
Okay! 
===
Oh yes, itÂs me! Sorry!
 What are you doing here?
===
Uh, IÂm just, IÂm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
in some places.
===
Oh my God, look-look heÂs taking off her clothes!
HeÂs taking off her coat!
===
Oh. 
Ho-oh, heÂs gonna get some!  Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. YÂknow so umm, heÂs closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.  Well, IÂm off to bed! 
===
Yeah. And yÂknow who shouldÂve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
 Is that a swing?
===
Oh donÂt even ask!
Yuck!
===
I canÂt believe Ross went out with RachelÂs sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
That was like 5 years ago.
===
Yeah you got 5 years left!
JoeyÂ
===
 You didnÂt cry when BambiÂs mother died?
the deer!
===
Chandler thereÂs nothing wrong with crying! I mean you donÂt have to be so macho all the time.
IÂm not macho.
===
Yeah youÂre right. I donÂt know what I was thinking.
No, I guess I just never really cried. YÂknow? IÂm not a crying kind of guy.
===
Come on man thereÂs gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
IÂd be sad sure, but I wouldnÂt cry.
===
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, IÂm rich!
===
All right, whatÂs going on there? 
Oh, thatÂs ParentÂs Day, first grade. ThatÂs me with the janitor Martin.
===
Where were your parents?
Oh they didnÂt want to come!
===
So that story doesnÂt make you cry?
No! Look, I donÂt cry! ItÂs not a big deal! Okay?!
===
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I donÂt think itÂs the kind youÂre gonna like.
You didnÂt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
===
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yÂknow she had such a terrible childhood.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I donÂt do porn.
===
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Her ankle is what youÂre watching?
===
Well itÂs hard to tellÂ  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
SheÂs just doing her job!
===
Hey sweetie!
Hey! 
===
 
ThereÂs no back to this couch!
===
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yÂknow? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnÂt think I was yÂknow, all dead inside.
===
Oh thatÂs so sweet! Look Chandler I donÂt care if you canÂt cry, I love you.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
===
Stop it!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, weÂre up at the altar and IÂm like this. 
===
I wonÂt care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. 
Yeah?
===
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you donÂt cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wonÂt matter to me.
Okay, well I wonÂt uh, worry about this anymore then.
===
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youÂre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still canÂt shed one tiny tear, I know youÂll be crying a river inside.
Aww, I love you soÂ
===
What is wrong with you?!!!
What?!
===
What?! You canÂt shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
So you didnÂt mean any of that?!
===
What?! You kissed!
 Maybe we should give them some privacy.
===
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
 I just donÂt see why those two canÂt work things out!
===
Bye.
 I-I canÂt believe JillÂs gone.  I canÂt help it, I opened a gate.
===
IÂd bet IÂd still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yÂknow, not doing anything else physical.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
===
And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldnÂt be dating me, thatÂs for sure.
Sure I would!
===
Oh dear God, let me think. 
 Hey.
===
Bye-bye.  Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. 
Was his question whatÂs more boring than him?
===
thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
===
Really?
Ehh.
===
ThatÂs great! That would be great! LetÂs do that!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
===
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Okay!
===
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I donÂt need any assistance in there, take a break!
All right!
===
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. 
Hey.
===
 You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well itÂs kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that heÂs not real.
===
 Hey there you are!
Uh-oh, itÂs my boss!
===
All right, hereÂs a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work IÂm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! 
 Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
===
 You realize what you are donÂt you?
What?
===
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
are all right?!
===
 My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I canÂt breathe.
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! 
===
Sorry. So howÂs it going with Joey?
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "IÂm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "IÂm lost and I canÂt find food."
===
Okay, you watch too much TV.
 Here you go Joe, hereÂs the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. 
===
Thanks!  Yeah, thereÂs pulp in that. 
Yeah?
===
I thought we talked about this. I donÂt like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnÂt juice. All juice, okay?
IÂm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
===
 Iced tea.
Okay, anything for you sir?
===
 Okay look, Chandler, if this  you have got to listen!   YouÂre gonna throw that juice at me, arenÂt ya?
ItÂs not all juice! 
===
Oh my God! ThatÂs great! Oh wow!  YouÂre a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Aww.
===
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say IÂm sorry. Here.  
WhatÂs this?
===
pulp! Just the way you like it.
Aww, thanks man. 
===
Oh my God! ThatÂs great! Congratulations! WhatÂs the story?!
Oh you wouldnÂt uh, care. ItÂs just a stupid comic book story.
===
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesnÂt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistÂas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that canÂt have lumps in them.
===
She doesnÂt know she was fired yet, does she?
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
===
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
think we should tell her.
===
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! 
Listen Phoebe, heÂs right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
===
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Uh, what about yÂknow the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
===
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like heÂs here.  "HereÂs some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnÂt add the second cous until 1979." 
===
Stop it!! ThatÂs not funny!!
Okay.
===
IÂm sorry, okay? It justÂtonight was supposed to be yÂknow, it was supposed to be a big deal.
What was tonight?
===
You donÂt want to know what tonight was.
Okay.  What was tonight?
===
Well, tonight wasÂwas going to be my first time.
With Roger?  Not just with Roger?!  Oh my God!
===
All right relax Mr. IÂve Had Sex Four Times!
Four different women! IÂve had sex way more times!
===
How many?
Nine.
===
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
===
No. HeÂs not a horrible guy.
Hey thatÂs what I tell girls about me.
===
Chandler, IÂm gonna die a virgin!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
===
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay. 
===
I was kidding.
So was I.
===
No!  Oyster?
Yeah!  If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, yÂknow? Because youÂve been waiting a very long time and I wouldnÂt want to disappoint you.
===
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if youÂre horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.
===
ItÂs harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
===
Absolutely! It would just be one friend  helping out another friend. 
Stop it! WeÂre doing this! LetÂs do it!
===
Noo!! Okay!!
Okay! 
===
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I have some moves.
===
I have no moves.  Okay, whatcha doinÂ there?!  Oh yÂknow what? IÂm sorry, this is just too weird.
Yeah, letÂs just forget it.
===
What if I turn out the lights? 
Okay!
===
Chandler?
 Yeah?
===
again!
Oh, okay! 
===
Hey!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
===
Hey, check me out, IÂm a slut!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
===
Oh I canÂt. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because youÂre still seeing him and uh, heÂs a good guy. I mean, I remember a time whenÂ 
===
Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
===
YÂknow, I donÂt have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure youÂre okay?
Oh yeah! Yeah! DonÂt worry about me, IÂll be fine! 
===
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
===
What?!
IÂm the ruptured spleen.  
===
Why would you do that?
Because you shouldnÂt be with him.  You should be with me.
===
Really?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they donÂt just happen. YÂknow? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning yÂknow I was just lying there and I couldnÂt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yÂknow with a friend.
===
Chandler!
I know you probably donÂt want to go out with me, yÂknow because I make too many jokes and IÂve never been in a serious relationship and I guess IÂm not technically a "doctorÂ"
===
There was just one woman, wasnÂt there?
No, there were two.
===
Including me?
Oh yeah.
===
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Yeah.
===
 Hey! So, whatÂs with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
===
YÂknow whatÂs more generous than that?! Fifty percent! YÂknow whatÂs even more generous than that?!!
I see where youÂre goinÂ!
===
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
 Ah, finally an explanation.
===
YÂknow whatÂ 
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
===
No.
Okay, look I need your help, I donÂt know what to get her for ValentineÂs Day.
===
Well, ValentineÂs Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldnÂt get her a calendar!
 She was working on ValentineÂs Day so weÂre celebrating it tonight.
===
And of course, crotchless panties. 
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  and her brother,  I canÂt do that we promised weÂd make each other gifts this year.
===
 Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
===
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
I made aÂ 
===
What is that?
Nothing!
===
So what are you gonna do?
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
===
 Hey!
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the ValentineÂs Day gifts?
===
Oh, yeah.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
===
Yes! Why, did youÂyou forget to make yours?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
===
Okay.  Okay, I canÂt wait! This is going to be the best ValentineÂs Day ever!  I canÂt believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
 What?
===
 Chandler. I sensed it was you.
What?!
===
Unagi. IÂm always aware.
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
===
WhatÂs up?
I canÂt figure out what to make Monica.
===
Oh, why donÂt you make her one of your little jokes.
IÂm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
===
YÂknow what? SheÂd-sheÂd love this.  Uh, itÂs an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
===
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnÂt actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. 
Wait a minute, I canÂt give this to her.
===
Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
===
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Okay, come here! Come here.
===
Okay! 
Now, itÂs not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
===
Okay.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
===
on it?!
 Maybe weÂll have to listen and see!
===
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Okay!
===
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Yeah!

Not really.

Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See thatÂs what this is about.

Oops!  YÂknow, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.

Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, thereÂs a big selling calendar, eh?
===
Oh, Âcause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, thereÂs your admirer. 
A hot girlÂs at stake and all of the sudden heÂs Rain Man.
===
ItÂs a girl! Anyway, it wouÂit wouldnÂt matter. Okay? Because IÂm a teacher and

 We didnÂt get to the audition. IÂm gonna take her to coffee and then weÂll do it then.
===
Wow! So, now youÂre going on a date with this girl?
Honey, it is not a date! I havenÂt talked to her in ten years! You canÂt just call up somebody you havenÂt talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yÂknow? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
===
YouÂre right, IÂm sorry. ItÂs not like youÂre yÂknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
No, we only went out once.
===
You dated her!
Not once!
===
YÂknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
 My friendÂs name is Joey.
===
Apparently HowieÂs editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! YÂknow I-I-I havenÂt spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, IÂve always hated that Howie.
===
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?
===
Yeah!
Refill?
===
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
I couldnÂt do it.
===
You couldnÂt do it?!
Hey, relax I just need more time. WeÂre going to dinner tonight.
===
Going out with who?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
===
Oh yeah! WasnÂt she uhÂ 
No, that was Dana Caplin.
===
YÂknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
===
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I donÂt feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, thatÂs notÂNo-no-no!
===
IÂm sorry Chandler, yÂknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I donÂt want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-noÂReally?!
===
Of course!
 Well, it just hurts so bad. I uhÂ
===
Ohh, IÂm sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
===
What?! Anything! Anything! 
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
===
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. IÂll see you later. 
===
Hey, here you go. 
 Ni-hi-ice! 
===
Thanks!
 So, you busy Thursday?
===
Oh, very funny. I donÂt know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday.  You got me the audition?! LetÂs hug it up! 
Okay. Okay.  What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
===
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Really?
===
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
No! No! No! I was so careful! 
===
Hey!

===
So?
ItÂs Thursday! How was the audition?!
===
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.

So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
===
IÂm the student.
 IsnÂt she cute?  No!
===
Oh that is quite all right maÂam. 
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
===
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
===
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Oh thatÂs so funny because we found someone too.
===
Oh thatÂs good, I guess sheÂll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
===
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these 
A face ass?
===
Have you seen your guyÂs body?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
===
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
 Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
===
My guy is well read.
Our guy has great hair.
===
My guy has great teeth!
Our guy smells incredible.
===
Huh.
Well, youÂdonÂt look good Joe.
===
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesÂHey, what was in that brown jar?
ThatÂs still in there?!
===
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service youÂre providing me?
===
No! No! No! For my new fridgeÂour new fridge!
new fridge? I donÂt live here anymore.
===
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Uh-huh.
===
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
 OkayÂ
===
You donÂt understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, IÂm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Just tell her the truth! Tell her youÂre not ready.
===
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
doll.
===
Oh-ho-ho, you think I donÂt know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!  Well what do you know! Broken! ThatÂll be $400!

===
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Uh-huh.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didnÂt want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that sheÂs going to Florida for spring vacation.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? 
===
I went to Egypt with my dad.
I can see it now, "Look dad, itÂs the Sphinx!" 
===
IÂm gonna call her.
Yeah.
===
Well, yÂknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think IÂm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
===
No reason, itÂs just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Are you funny?
===
Okay! See you later! 
 Turns out he is kinda funny. 
===
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A catÂs name?
===
All right.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
===
Yes, IÂll meet Âem.
Okay now it doesnÂt matter which one you choose, yÂknow? ItÂs completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
===
time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
You know the hotels?
===
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
marry this one.
===
Hey!
Good-good-good-good.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
I donÂt know. I know I donÂt work late tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, yÂknow what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now?  Eldad come here! 
===
Well-well a little blind sided but yÂknow good.
Eldad, sit down.  Move over! Move over now!
===
IÂOhh! 
There you go! There you are! 
===
Hi.
Hi.  Okay, youÂre too late okay? Because sheÂs already with our guy.
===
Rachel! Rachel! You havenÂt touched EldadÂs hair!
It is the softest hair! Touch it! 
===
ThatÂs right Patrick, bye-bye!
 Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance!  You dance for Rachel!
===
Oh thatÂs all right! YÂknow, I ended up having a really good time. YÂknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
So what was it for anyway?
===
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Yeah.
===
ThatÂs the title! Yeah! YÂknow they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
That is lucky.
===
Well, donÂt get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
===
ItÂs your turn.
Oh, are we playing this?!
===
 Hey.
Hey! HowÂd the audition go?
===
Totally!
So it did go well.

Great!
Oh thatÂs great!
===
Yeah-yeah, itÂs down to me and two other guys.
Oh my God!
===
Oh, I love that guy! 
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
===
IÂm just so nervous! YÂknow? The callback isnÂt until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Well, it is overdue.
===
 Ahh! ArenÂt you dressed yet?
 Am I naked again?!
===
WeÂre supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
===
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh right, your allergies.  All her, she hates you. 
===
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
As crazy as soccer?
===
 Hello?  What are you talking about? The auditionÂs not Âtil 5:00!  Well, nobody told me!  WhoÂd you talk to?  Nevermind! 
You mean you didnÂt get it from this?
===
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well, maybe we can fix it yÂknow? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
===
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldÂve turned my whole career around!
I messed up. Okay? IÂm sorry, I really messed up.
===
Hey, you donÂt even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodyÂs allowed one mistake, right?
===
Hi, Joey.  Well well, look what you brought.
...And what did you bring?
===
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
===
No way!Â  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Oh come on!Â  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
===
What?
Cupping.
===
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There arenÂt any message youÂve forgotten to give me are there?  Apparently youÂre not very good at it! IÂ
Do you think heÂll ever forgive me?
===
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
YÂknow what? I-I kinda have.
===
forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in caseÂ  OkayÂ
You didnÂt see how mad he was, yÂknow?
===
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh my God!Â  
===
Hey!
Please tell me you got the message!
===
What message?
The actor playing Mac couldnÂt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oÂclock.
===
What?! ItÂs 6 oÂclock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to RossÂs! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
===
I canÂt believe this Chandler!
Sorry! I-I-I donÂt know what to say.
===
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
 Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
===
Oh, well IÂm uhÂ
YÂknow, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
===
Oh wow! Okay man, IÂm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Well thatÂs good. Because you didnÂt! And IÂm incredibly happy for ya!!
===

And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
 Oh, well thank you in advance. 
===
 Hey guys!

Wait a minute, hold the phone! YouÂre not ElizabethÂs dad?!
===

===
 Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
ThereÂs a Mr. Bing!
===
Oh, you donÂt have to do that every time.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny storyÂ  YouÂre roommate in college died didnÂt he?
===
 Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Yes, we were justÂ

No, you said the baby creeps you out.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
===
You said the baby.
Why would the baby creep me out?
===
 You guys, IÂm sorry, could you please talk a little slower? 
This is going in your book?
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
ThatÂs not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow IÂm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. 
So do you think uh, JoeyÂs more charming than me?
===
Yeah! ThatÂs why IÂm sleeping with him on the side.
Yeah, you wish. 
===
IÂm not writing about you! IÂm writing about other people.
Who?
===
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, IÂll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Hmm.
===
 Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Oh.
===
 Phyllis sees what IÂm doing.
Oh-oh.
===
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
We said seven!
===
We said six!
The only way that I said six would be if the sevenÂs, let meet at seven, not at six.
===
 Hi!
Oh my good God.
===
I know what time you said.
What?!
===
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly itÂs my book to the rescue, huh?  Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
 What does it say?!
===
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
===
Thanks! So are you.
you I should not wear this color. 
===
 MonÂ  Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks theyÂre supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks itÂs at seven.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
===
I canÂt believe IÂm going to lose this job!
Oh IÂm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
===
Yeah? Well, I donÂt want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. 
Hi, how are ya?
===
 Why should I help you?!
 The reason he just said.
===
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Yeah, IÂve been there my friend.
===
 Hi, you guys.
Hey!
===
No! No! ItÂs just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
IÂll give up my ticket.
===
Okay thatÂs so generous!
And I think Ross is generous too.
===
Hi!
Hey!
===
 Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. IÂm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if sheÂs still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is availableÂ 
 This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomÂNo! Not the groom!!
===
Hi, honey.
 See you later. 
===
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
 Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! 
===
Oh please, he didnÂt hear it! He didnÂt hear it!!
 This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! 
===
 IÂm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
IÂm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. 
===
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, whatÂs the harm in that?
Right here! 
===
Chandler, please donÂt think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and RachelÂ
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
===
It was a mistake. Please donÂt take this to mean anything, because it doesnÂt.
Okay.
===
Really?
Yes, if it really doesnÂt mean anything, because you know that IÂm just not readyÂ
===
I know! I know.
Okay. 
===
 Hey, did she buy it?
Totally.
===
So did Heldi show you the place?
Yeah, itÂs beautiful.
===
I canÂt believe youÂre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
===
Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I donÂt want to tell anybody else because I donÂt want Monica to find out.
===
You told me.
Well, itÂs because I trust you, youÂre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
===
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnÂt been on the toilet.
Me too.
===
Hey. 
Hey.
===
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? 
Oh all right.
===
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, we donÂt because we gotÂtheÂother pl-place.
===
Okay, so maybe you donÂt get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. YÂknow? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, yÂknow? Or an engagement tiara? OrÂooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
YÂknow, IÂm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
===
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Yeah, IÂm gonna stick with the ring.  Oh, this oneÂs nice!  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
===
Can I help you?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
===
This ring is from the 1920s, itÂs a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youÂhold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
===
Okay.  Will you marry me?
 Oh my God thatÂs it, thatÂs the ring! How much is it?
===
 Are you interested in this ring?!
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
===
 How would you like to pay?
Uh, credit card.  Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey.  Okay, IÂll go get it. You guard the ring.
===
Rachel?
No. How are ya Paul? 
===
 Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
No, did he hug you?!
===
No! No! ItÂs just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
===
Hey Chandler?
Yeah?
===
Would youÂÂ.Would you hug me?
IÂm a little busy here Paul.
===
ThatÂs exactly what my dad used to say! 
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.  Oh hey! There you go.  Okay. 
===
Five more seconds.
Okay! 
===
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!  Hi, Paul is it? 
Do you have my credit card?
===
Yes, itÂs in myÂ InÂin my pocket.   My back pocket! My back pocket!
Thank God! 
===
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Oh, I canÂt go.
===
Chandler, I found the perfect ring. 
Oh, thatÂs uh, thatÂs pretty nice but IÂm gonna go with the one I picked first.
===
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. ItÂs over!
What?
===
Some guy bought it. IÂm sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
They put you in jail?
===
The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
===
I know, IÂm sorry! But yÂknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
===
Maybe it was the guy.
It was the ring!
===
 Hey.
I canÂt believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
===
ItÂs not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! ItÂs a beautiful ring!
No, itÂs not! When I looked at the other ring I could see MonicaÂs face when I gave it to her, yÂknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing IÂm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure itÂs perfect.
===
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ÂCause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
I canÂt do that.
===
There he is! 
Okay and he hasnÂt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
===
Wow! YouÂre good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
===
 Here he is.
 Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youÂre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, IÂm gonna need to have that back.  But, in exchange IÂm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew.
===
It is beautiful, but IÂm gonna use this one. Now, if youÂll excuse me.
No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You donÂt want to break her heart now do you?
===
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if IÂm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternityÂ
 Okay, thatÂs enough honey!
===
I donÂt know.  Let me see the ring.
Great! Okay, here. 
===
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Yeah, check out the ring. 
===
So you two are really serious?!
Yep, pretty much.
===
And-and-and-and-and-and, and weÂre gonna be friends again! 
 HeyyyyÂWhat?
===
Oh itÂs water under the bridge, forget it!
Okay!  I was gonna wait Âtil uh, it was official yÂknow? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youÂre my best friends.
===
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!!  You guys are gonna be so happy!
I know.
===
You told her before you told us?
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys? 
===
Yeah, you didnÂt get one.
Okay, well tonightÂs the big night.
===
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. IÂm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast IÂm just gonna propose.
===
That sounds perfect!
Yeah.
===
YouÂre gonna mess it up let me do it.
IÂm not gonna mess it up.
===
If she says no, can I have the ring?
SheÂs not gonna say no.
===
ItÂs gone.
Phoebe!
===
Hey!
 Hi Monica.
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
 Well, Monica and Chandler canÂt go. WeÂre going to dinner remember?!
===
WhatÂs the big deal?
I just get mad when Rachel doesnÂt remember where weÂre going.
===
Hey, yÂknow what? IÂll come too. IÂm making money now; itÂs about time I give something back.
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
===
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Oh, so youÂre already doing your part for the kids.
===
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnÂt agree to that!
===
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?
===
Oh! Oop! 
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and sheÂs gonna know.
===
Hi guys.
 You are beautiful.
===
What are you doing?
 One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  I remembered it.  The champagne is here.  
===
Are you okay?
Yes! Yes! IÂm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everythingÂare youÂare you perrr-perfect?!
===
Yeah. IÂm okay. IÂm actuallyÂIÂm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Oh, yeah.  Uh, no you canÂt have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you shouldÂve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
===
 Are you sure youÂre okay?
Yes! IÂm fine. In fact IÂve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
===
Ohh thatÂs sweet!
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldnÂt imagine growing old withÂ
===
 Oh my God!
 I know, but just let me say it.
===
Oh my God, Richard. 
What?! IÂm Chandler!  Oh, thatÂs Richard!
===
 Monica! Chandler!
Hey-hey, hey!  I donÂt know why I did that!
===
Well, my nose got lonely.
 And uh, you donÂt have a mustache which is good.  IÂm Chandler; I make jokes when IÂm uncomfortable.
===
Hi, IÂm Lisa.
Hi.
===
Oh, IÂm sorry.  Lisa,  Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us!  See I, did it again.
===
Chandler, wh-why donÂt we sit down?
Yeah, IÂll sit down. 
===
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Yes. 
===
Ohh.
What?!
===
Oh my God, you guys!! 
 Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
===
Who?
Richard!
===
What?  A-ohh!  Ohh. Oh thatÂs right thatÂs right. ThatÂs RichardÂs favorite place too.
Oh you knew that. Good!
===
 Okay. 
 What did you guys just do?!
===
What happened?
Richard was there so I couldnÂt do it!
===
What?! NooooÂ 
IÂm gonna do it tomorrow yÂknow, and-and surprise her, but now youÂve ruined it!
===
We didnÂt ruin it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a personÂs hands?!
===
Good one! Yeah.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
===
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnÂt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
ThatÂs right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
===
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that youÂre scared of commitment! Convince her that youÂre a little coward!
I can do that, IÂve had 30 years of practice.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
What are you up too?
Oh, just hanging out, talkinÂ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
===
Well thatÂs a little crazy. Although I am yÂknow glad to hear that youÂre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, wellÂ YÂknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
===
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
EhÂ
===
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you donÂt really believe that do you?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. LetÂs take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs donÂt mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thatÂs just an ordinary pig not even a pig thatÂs good at sports!
===
not people!
If marriage worked, IÂd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
===
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why donÂt you put down your copy of ÂThe RulesÂ huh mantrap?!
===
Where the hell have you been?!
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
===
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
What?!
===
Yeah! Yeah, IÂve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnÂt keep flying off!
MyÂOh my God!
===
I know! They suck!!
HeÂs not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! IÂm supposed to do that!
===
I know!
Well whatÂ YÂknow what IÂm gonna do? IÂm gonna go over there; IÂm gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!
===
Look, Chandler I donÂt think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just 
YouÂre right.
===
Yeah!
Okay.  IÂm gonna get the ring! IÂm gonna get the ring!  IÂm gonna go find her and  IÂm just going to propose!
===
Okay.
Okay great.
===
Dude-dude-dude!
What?!
===
Chandler.
Where is she? IÂm not scared of you! 
===
SheÂs not here and please come in.
 Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
===
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Well where did she go?
===
Well she said she had to think things over.
Oh my God, I canÂt believe this! YÂknow, I thoughtÂI thought you were a good guy.
===
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnÂt tell my girlfriend that you love her?
===
Well all right, one thing happened?
YÂknow what? I canÂt believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
===
Well IÂm sorry.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
===
Well, apparently IÂm willing to offer her things that you are not.
willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, yÂknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, sheÂd be surprised!
===
You were gonna propose? 
Yeah I even  got a ring.  Did you get a ring?
===
No I donÂt have a ring!  You go get her Chandler.  And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, donÂt let her go. Trust me.
YÂknow RichardÂyou are a good guy.
===
Dude!
I canÂt talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
===
SheÂs gone.
What?
===
SheÂs gone. She had a bag and she left.
What are you talking about?
===
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Well why didnÂt you stop her?! Why didnÂt you just tell her it was a plan?!
===
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnÂt believe me.
Well whereÂ Where did she go?
===
To her parentÂs I think and she said you shouldnÂt call her. But if I were you I would.
I canÂt believe I ruined this.
===
ChandlerÂ In all my lifeÂ I never thought I would be so lucky.  As toÂfall in love with my bestÂmy bestÂ ThereÂs a reason why girls donÂt do this!
Okay!  Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thoughtÂ  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if youÂll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?
===
Hey, whatÂs going on?
Hey.
===
WhatÂs up?
Monica and I are engaged.
===
Oh my God.  Congratulations.
Thanks.
===
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh!  Okay, umm, I just wanna say thatÂI love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night.  Our special night. I mean it just wouldnÂt be myÂour-our night, if you all werenÂt here to celebrate with meÂusÂDamnit!
ItÂs okay, I want this to be your night too.  To Monica.
===
Awww, come onÂwaitÂstop it. Okay, to Monica.
To Monica!
===
But I-I-I canÂt stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. IÂm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.  What?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
===
Okay.
Okay.
===
 YÂknow what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes!  YouÂre not getting dressed. 
Know what I mean?
===
Yeah, but I donÂt think we have time.
ThereÂs gonna be a wedding. YouÂre gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
===
 Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, donÂt worry about it!
 IÂm not worried, IÂm uh, IÂm fascinated. YÂknow itÂs like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. 
===
Hey!
You look great!
===
 Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?
===
I donÂt know, yÂknow? I feel a little ummÂ No, yÂknow what? Nevermind, IÂm gonna be fine.
Oh, donÂt worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
===
ÂSup? ÂSup dude?
 Take whatever you want, just please donÂt hurt me.
===
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! YouÂre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodyÂs ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
===
Wow thanks! 
Joe?
===
Yeah!
Uhh, youÂve had a lot of sex right?
===
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, itÂs just the reason that IÂm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toÂI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnÂtÂ. There huhÂhmm, there-there was an incident.
===
DonÂt worry about that man, that happens.
ItÂs happened to you?
===
Yeah! Once.
Well, whatÂd you do?
===
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
 I donÂt think thatÂs what they were talking about Joe!!
===
What? 
What?!
===
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Yes, you can pass for 19.
===
Really?
Yes!
===
Seriously?
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
===
Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
===
Keep talking.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because itÂs romantic, but because I can!
===
 Bonjour, monsieur.
Okay, donÂt say anything, you might scare it away.
===
YÂknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Pheebs, weÂre not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
===
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnÂt want to talk to anyone, especially me?
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
===
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
 Ahh, third base.
===
Uh, Rachel, IÂve been thinking. I donÂt think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. IÂm calling it off.
 Why to save your dignity my man.
===
 I canÂt believe youÂre gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Well, somebody should. 
===
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement IÂm going to announce that IÂm pregnant!
How is that ever going to happen?!
===
 Well, IÂm going to take off.  Congratulations man.
Thanks.
===
Oh thank you.
Okay. 
===
 Oww!
WhatÂs the matter honey?
===
Okay! 
 Already?!
===
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the musicÂ
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
===
 Okay! 
What in GodÂs name is that?!
===
for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Well, you couldnÂt get them anyway. Ian doesnÂt plan anymore and DerrickÂ  And Derrick is a name I shouldnÂt know.
===
 Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  YÂknow, something a little snugglyer?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
===
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Okay.
===
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Centerpieces!
===
Yeah! Roses or Lilies? 
Definitely roses.  Well, I just think theyÂre a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice.
===
Oh my God! ItÂs like one mind.
Uh-huh!
===
So Chandler, youÂre parents mustÂve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
===
I remember when we first got engaged.
Oh, I donÂt think I ever heard that story.
===
 You donÂt know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
===
ever propose!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. 
===
Wait, but thereÂs no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Honey, itÂs gonna be okay.
===
No, yÂknow what? ItÂs gonna be okay. I mean you donÂt have to have this rustic Italian feast. YÂknow? And-and you donÂt need, you donÂt need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. 
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that weÂre gonna get married.
===
How? I donÂt have any money.
Well, I have some.
===
How much?
Well, close toÂ  
===
 Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Well, youÂre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
===
Ah, yeah!
Well, come on, IÂve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
===
This is the most special day of our lives.
No, I realize that honey, but IÂm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
===
You-youÂre gonna have to put your foot down?
Yes, I am!
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
Listen umm, IÂve been thinking, itÂs not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Ehh.
===
Eh, you work for that.
Look, I thought about it too, and IÂm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
===
You do?!
Yeah, IÂm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thatÂs what weÂre gonna do.
===
You thought about that?
Yeah.
===
How many kids were we gonna have?
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
===
What else did you think about?
Well, stuff like whereÂd we live, yÂknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. YÂknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on itÂs collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, weÂd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
===
 YÂknow what? I-I donÂt want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do.
===
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
You sure?
===
Uh-hmm.
I love you so much.
===
I love you.  Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkinÂ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Oh yeah, totally!
===
Hey!
So, what do you think?
===
What?
Are you kidding? Okay, IÂll give you a hint; IÂll give you a hint. 
===
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. ChandlerÂs eyes!
I got glasses!
===
Well, you-youÂve always had glasses.
No I didnÂt!
===
Yes!
No!
===
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Really?
===
Yeah!
 You didnÂt think I used to wear glasses, right?
===
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
ThatÂs okay Pheebs, weÂre not having a party or anything, so you donÂt have to get usÂ
===
Hey, I know I what I want!
want honey.
===
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
things.
===
Okay. IÂm gonna be the mom that makes the worldÂs best chocolate chip cookies.
arenÂt they.
===
 Ahoy!
Hey! HowÂs the boat?!
===
Oh, itÂs great! ItÂs a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. 
Well, itÂs good that you finally have a place to do that.
===
What?
Nothing, I just like to go like this. 
===
 Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
===
No, why?
Then free as a bird. WhatÂs up?
===
Yeah and he didnÂt really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Well, did-did you correct him?
===
to lose.
Oh no problem, maybe IÂll play with my left hand.
===
YouÂre not a lefty? 
Does anybody know me?!
===
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
DonÂt worry about it Pheebs.
===
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.  
An old cookie?
===
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
We canÂt accept this.
===
Why not?
ÂCause itÂs gross.
===
had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other handÂ
will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
===
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Daddy. All right look, hereÂs the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and thatÂs when in happened.
===
Oh my God Chandler! I canÂt believe it!
I know.
===
You gave my father a lap dance!
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
===
ÂCause otherwise theyÂd have to call it the room room.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
===
Come on, itÂs not that big a deal!
Not that big a deal? ThereÂthere was touching of things.
===
Listen, IÂm sure that dad doesnÂt care. He probably thought this was funny; heÂll be telling this story for years!
I donÂt want him to tell this story for years.
===
 Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceÂAnd by face I donÂt mean his lap. And by face, I donÂt mean my ass. 
===
I understand completely, thereÂs nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
What did you do when they found out?
===
 Hello?  Hold on please. Joey, itÂs your mom. 
ItÂs your mommy. ItÂs your mommy.
===
It wasnÂt the best.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
===
I donÂt know. I donÂt know. I canÂt lie to him again. Oh no IÂno! IÂm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
And say nothing?
===
 Hey sweetie.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
===
I canÂt tell you. ItÂs a secret.
Secret? Married people arenÂt supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
===
Really? Okay, so why donÂt you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at 
Oh no-no, I canÂt do that.
===
If you tell me, IÂll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay.
===
Oh my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was PhoebeÂs secret?
===
Oh, Nancy Thompson from PhoebeÂs old massage place is getting fired.
story for that?
===
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
 Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
===
No, I-I just donÂt know how you decide who to hire. I mean IÂve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then thereÂs this guyÂ
What about him?
===
Okay youÂre right. IÂll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! DonÂt show this to Monica! And donÂt tell her about the W-H-Wow!
===
Hey! Good, youÂre home!
Oh itÂs always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
===
Hey baby. 
Hey.
===
I made you a surprise.
Oh yeah?
===
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story IÂve had such a craving for them.
Did you not understand the story?
===
 Hey!
Hey! WhatÂs up?
===
Oh, nothinÂ much. Just trying to figure out what IÂm gonna do for dinner.
Huh.
===
 HeyÂOoh! WhatÂs-whatÂs that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
No!  Shhh!
===
 You told her!
Nancy ThompsonÂs getting fired! 
===
 How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! WeÂre getting married! Married couples canÂt keep secrets from one another!
===
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!
===
Well, Chandler and I are in a barÂ
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
===
 You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
===
Oh Mon, I laughed so hardÂ
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
===
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross came in forth and cried!
===
ItÂs hard for some people!
 Of course it is.  WowÂwhoa!
===
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Hey!!!
===
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
That was you!
===
defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
 You have no trouble telling time now right?
===
No!
Quick! What time is it?! 
===
I donÂt know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!  What are you laughing at 
YÂknow when I said that because weÂre getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets? 
===
Yeah?
Yeah that was stupid. LetÂs not do that.
===
Man! 
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnÂt hang out withÂall the guys in my office.
===
WhatÂs the matter?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
===
Oh WillieÂs still alive!
What are you guys doing?
===
Oh, my mom called, theyÂre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so weÂre looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, IÂm afraid that does not exist.
===
ThatÂs not true, there are great pictures of us!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whoÂs going like thisÂ 
===
 Oh, hereÂs a great one.
Yeah, IÂm not in that.
===
Chandler what do you say?
All right, but I should warn you, IÂm not going. IÂm going. 
===
 Dude, that reverse lay-up! OhÂ
How about those three pointers?
===
Amazing!
 close to lettinÂ us play this time too.
===
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
===
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
===
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yÂknow you canÂt date him right?
===
Maybe I should open a divorced menÂs club.
Dude that is so sad.
===
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Could I play?
===
 Great! ThatÂs great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Okay. 
===
IÂm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
No, I am.
===
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do? 
===
Yeah!  All right, maybe you donÂt have to smile. LetÂs try something else. LetÂs try umm, try looking sexy.
Okay. 
===
I know. LetÂs try a lookÂof far offÂwonderment. Okay, weÂll-weÂll gaze into our future and weÂll think about our marriage and the days to come.  Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"  Hey! DonÂt laugh at him! HeÂs 
Aww! 
===
They canÂt all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
===
See? ThatÂs a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera.  YouÂre changing it!
I canÂt help it!
===
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Borrow money from me?
===
Okay, firstÂfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up.  See? All right, now you try. Look down , youÂre looking down, keep looking downÂ
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Hey well, you canÂt teach someone to be good with women. YÂknow, thatÂs why I never had any luck with Chandler.
 IÂm right here!
===
Hey! No-no-no-no, you canÂt take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
IÂm still right here!
===
I know, Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
===
Yeah. Sure. 
Can you people not see me?! 
===
 Hey! There you are!
There I am!
===
Are you okay?
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
===
What?!
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
===
Chandler, what were you thinking?
I donÂt know, but donÂt worry, donÂt worry, because I know how to take a picture now.  Okay, see? Look down , look down, look downÂ 
===
Chandler?
 Yeah! 
===
Ooh, letÂs see it!
Ahhh.
===
Okay. 
Oh yeah, that looks good.
===
do!
Okay.
===
YÂknow, we donÂt have to imagine.
IÂm marrying her.
===
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
WhatÂd you rent?
===
Dude, you didnÂt say 
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
===
Well, John McLane had plans!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
===
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheÂshe wished me good luck.
ThatÂs sweet.
===
No, itÂs more like a  good luck.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
===
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
===
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractiveÂ  Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
===
What are you doing?
Well, letÂs seeÂ  Okay uh, is that her? 
===
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
===
Did you break up with her?
 No, weÂre still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
===
Why?
Well, Âcause she came back the third summer and sheÂd gotten really fa-aa-aw-owÂ
===
Fat?!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-owÂ"
===
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
===
Well, apparently she does.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me.
===
Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Can you figure out what IÂm doing?
===
YouÂre Lewis Posin.
Who?
===
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
===
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaaÂ.  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! YÂknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
===
Hello Skidmark.
 ItÂs a nickname, IÂll explain later.
===
ItÂs pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
===
ThatÂs why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didnÂt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
===
Why donÂt you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnÂt have to apologize.
I would really love it if could do both.
===
All right, IÂI have to ask.
What?
===
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!
===
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
===
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! ThatÂs not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
===
WellÂ ThatÂs not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
===
How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
===
What if I have babies, okay? I mean IÂm gonna look different. IÂm okay with that, but IÂm not sure that you are!
Look you have to realize I donÂt think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youÂre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. 
===
Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
===
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
IÂd carry you around in my pocket.
===
I love you. 
SkidmarkÂs still got a way with the ladies.
===
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, yÂknow-yÂknow for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! ItÂs here! Yeah, itÂs right-itÂs right down here! In the biggest library in the university! 
Wow thatÂs actually pretty cool.
===
 Oh umm, thereÂs also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
===
Sorry!
You didnÂt bring me here to do that, did you?
===
Well, she saw the ring.
Did she freak out?
===
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Right.
===
Well, she actually has a boyfriend yÂknow herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
 You said no right?
===
Huh?
right?!
===
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checkÂs in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I canÂt wait to read your book Ross!!
===
Oh my God, sheÂs not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
YÂknow what? ItÂs gonna be okay. YÂknow what? SheÂs probably not gonna even want to come.
===
So-so you wouldÂve just lied?
Yes!!
===
Would it really have been that easy?
Yes!!!
===
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why donÂt you tell about your lovely wedding?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, itÂs going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! WeÂre not even sure why weÂre having it.
===
Chandler?
 Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
===
Please, itÂs because otherwise I really donÂt know what I might do.
ArenÂt you just a tinsy bit curious?
===
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Is that what youÂre thinking about right now?
===
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Janice, IÂm sorry but umm, you canÂt stay here tonight.
===
He does?
Say again?
===
ThatÂs right. ThatÂs right. And that is why you canÂt stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnÂt come to the wedding.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
===
 Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! 
No, no, no. No-no-no. 
===
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? 
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes. 
===
What? That's like insanely easy! 
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . 
===
All right, I got 48. 
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? 
===
Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery. 
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inÂvegetables, Joey? 
===
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 
Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go. 
===
Done! With time a-to-spare. 
Oooh that may be a New World's record  
===
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? 
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.  
===
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! 
man!  Okay Ross, time is up! 
===
No, just give me another minute. 
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. 
===
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner. 
Okay, but if you can'tÂno dinner! 
===
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?  
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 
===
RossÂs apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often? 
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something. 
===
That's my pie! 
Which smells delicious! 
===
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
What? 
===
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! 
===
No that's just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room. 
What is it doing here? 
===
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! 
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! 
===
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
 Really? 
===
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 
Well, it still has to go, right?
===
Why? 
Okay, it's umÂ
===
Don't do what? 
 I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs. 
===
Told ya. 
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. 
===
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? 
 Is there a puppy here? 
===
You don't like puppies? 
 Okay, you are new!
===
cold. 
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 
===
 It hurts my teeth.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!
===
Where's Chandler? 
 Here I am. 
===
Wash your hands!!!
How did youÂknow?  
===
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.  
 Where's Monica? 
===
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. 
Why not? 
===
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
Well, I, I should go in there. 
===
right now. 
Why not? 
===
Because you sent away the dog!
This is ridiculous.  
===
 Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter? 
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. 
===
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
===
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
And that doesn't scare you?  
===
 Hey, is Chandler here? 
No, no he went for a walk. 
===
Hi, honey. 
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 
===
 Hi! 
Clunkers?! Oh my god! 
===
It's a Thanksgiving miracle! 
 It is so good to see you! 
===
Delaware!  Delaware!
All right. 
===
 I want my turkey now! 
You got it.  You got Nevada twice. 
===
 I know. 
Yeah. 
===
Uh-huh!
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. 
===
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
IÂm sorry, who?
===
IÂm gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we donÂt know the neighbors.
===
why IÂm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
WouldnÂt it be easier if we just moved?
===
 Gooood morning!!
Eh, somebodyÂs in a good mood!
===
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Well, either that or uhÂ
===
 Oh and ChandlerÂs about to cry.
 Am not!
===
 Who is that?!
DonÂt worry, IÂm brave! I am brave! IÂI am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please?
===
Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
 4:00 A.M.
===
 Mm! Seems like I wouldÂve remembered you!
Mm! Night GarÂ! 
===
Oh hi!
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
===
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
 What happened? IÂm just eating candy.
===
Maybe itÂs not as bad as I think. YÂknow, maybe they didnÂt take it the way I meant it.
Absolutely! YÂknow, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
===
Oh my God! Joey!
What is the matter with you?
===
 Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Maybe, isnÂt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
===
 ItÂs unbelievable! I-I canÂt believe that sign didnÂt work!
YÂknow what would work?
===
Hmm?
Stop making candy!
===
But they like it!
You mean they like you.
===
Maybe.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
===
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Joey!
===
WhatÂs up buddy?
What are you doing?
===
Waiting for candy.
Get in here!  Hey, and you can not smoke in here!   Merry Christmas.
===
We want candy! We want candy now! 
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and IÂll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
===
 Candy Lady?
No not  Candy Lady.
===
 Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
All right, yÂknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it! YouÂve ruined it! Go home! YouÂve ruined it! YouÂve ruined it!
===
 Thank you.
YouÂre welcome. 
===
Did you smoke?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uhÂare you okay?
===
BetrothedÂ 
Âbetrothed couple.
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
Haaaa...  ... ahhhh!
Pheebs?
===
Huh?
Skull?
===
No.
How long have we been home?
===
No.
Why not?
===
 Oh, hey, you guys!
Hey!
===
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
===
Yeah, why not?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
===
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, exceptÂsheÂtoldÂme.
===
Really? So she said, she didnÂt wanna live with me anymore?
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
===
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
at 8:00.
===
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
===
 You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
===
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakinÂ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
===
You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. 
===
Of course, sir.
Okay. 
===
How did it go?
Had the money in the wrong hand. 
===
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
How do you know so much about this?
===
I don't know.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
===
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastardÂ
===
 Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
 Excuse me...
===
 Good evening. 
 Ahh-hahaha! 
===
Here you go.
Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you.
===
Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.
Hey Pheebs!
===
Hey! 
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
===
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
 Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
===
Santa! 
Hey! 
===
What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weirdÂturtle-man?
===
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
What?
===
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho!
===
 What are you doing?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
===
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Why?
===
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-youÂre wrecking it.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
===
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
===
 Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? 
Santa? Really?
===
Yes, is that okay?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
===
No.
Then it's okay! 
===
No! Why does he have to go?
Because, if Santa and the HolidayÂArmadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
===
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
===
Yeah?
flew all the Jews out of Egypt. 
===
 Hi.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
===
Oh, yÂknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. IÂÂWow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? 
 It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
===
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.
IÂno! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
===
Why, why not?
Because it's too delicious.
===
All right, I should get going, big day a work. YÂknow IÂm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out IÂm not brain dead.
SoÂ
===
Okay.  
Oh, whatÂs at 8:00?
===
My God, I canÂt believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Well, maybe since the age of 9, FrannieÂs made some new friends.
===
YÂknow, she tried to undress me too.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn. 
===
Hi!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
===
So just bring it back downstairs, whatÂs the problem?
I canÂt seem to say goodbye.
===
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well IÂve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
===
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese fillingÂ  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva! 
are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
===
Yeah and weÂll drop it off downstairs so that weÂre not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
===
What? Wait a minute, I didnÂt pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we just donÂt pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?
===
 Its still there! 
Mrs. Braverman must be out. 
===
She could be out of town. Maybe sheÂll be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We donÂt want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
===
No that could kill her.
Well, we donÂt want that.
===
No so weÂre protecting her.
But we should take it.
===
But we should move quick.
Why?
===
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
===
 Oh my God! That is so good!
IÂm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, IÂll regret it.
===
Oh itÂs umm, itÂs tofu cake. Do you want some? 
What are you doing tonight?
===
Huh? UhÂ 
Dude! Dude! 
===
Oh!  Sorry. Uh, IÂve got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
===
What?! Tonight?!
ThatÂs what Monica said.
===
 Mm-mmm. 
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
===
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
YÂknow what? I donÂt trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and IÂm takinÂ it back! 
===
What?! What?!
Oh yes! 
===
Wait a minute!
Oh yes!
===
You think I trust you with it?! No! WeÂre gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well thatÂs not fair, youÂve already had some!
===
What? Oh, well then yÂknow what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
to split it?
===
Okay!  All right, pick a half.
 Okay well, this side looks bigger. UhÂ ThereÂs more crust on this side. YÂknow? So, maybe if I measuredÂ
===
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, IÂll pick that one. 
===
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and donÂt come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat myÂ  
===
Oh! Yay! Look! ThereÂs a piece that doesnÂt have floor on it!
Stick to your side!
===
 There it is! Oh, look at that! IsnÂt Mother Nature amazing?
 ThatÂs a plane!
===
Okay, weÂve been out here for two hours and we havenÂt seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, ChandlerÂs getting chilly. 
 No, IÂm not!
===
Then why are you wearing MonicaÂs jacket?
Because itÂs flattering!  Come on Monica! Come on Monica! 
===
is whatÂs going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I justÂcanÂt sleep. Ooh!  Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover IÂm likeÂ
===
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
What?!  Ow! 
===
With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
===
Here, let me make the milk, IÂm up anyway.
Hey, yÂknow what we can do? YÂknow, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, yÂknow like we did when we were first going out. ItÂd be fun!
===
Okay that does sound like fun. 
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
===
The second sister dies?!
 No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
===
The second sister dies in 
ThatÂs correct.
===
Okay, hereÂs your milk. What do you want to talk about? 
 What? What? What?
===
Are you still awake?
Yeah! You?
===
You do know that was me who just said that right?  Hey. As long as weÂre both upÂ
 Yeah?  I hope youÂre not thinking about cleaning the living room.
===
What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what just happened?
===
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
fell asleep.
===
Nooo! No, thatÂs not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world! 
 Monica?
===
Okay. Okay, IÂm ready. Come on big fella!
Okay.
===
Give me the good stuff.
Yeah!  No! No! No! DonÂt fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee.  And I probably wonÂt spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
===
That really was some of your best work.
Hm-hmm, I told you!  I canÂt believe that IÂve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
===
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, youÂre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutesÂ
===
Really?!
Do you wanna?
===
Hey, yÂknow whatÂs weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youÂre gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." ThatÂs weird isnÂt it?
CouldnÂt I just say, "This is Ross?"
===
 Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes weÂre surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?
 Sorry! 
===
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
===
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Yeah, IÂd love to but IÂve tried that so many times they wonÂt even let me in the store anymore.
===
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
 Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
===
Well, itÂs a long story, but umm I broke JoeyÂs chairÂ
broke JoeyÂs chair?
===
Yeah.
broke JoeyÂs chair! ThatÂs why I replaced it with mine!
===
Ohhhhh. ThatÂs how it got fixed!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
===
Noo!  Angels.
IÂm gettinÂ my chair back! 
===
Well, it looks like it wasnÂt heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! 
Joey you broke my chair!!
===
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you donÂt get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!
I think I should get the chair!
===
How do you figure?
 broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnÂt broke a chair, is me!
===
No-no-no! This chairÂs not going anywhere.
Well, whereÂs the logic in that?!
===
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
===
ThatÂs right!
or something?!
===
 Hey.
 SheÂs not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
===
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
No Rach, itÂs not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnÂt that much fun.
===
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Ross, a sports car? WouldnÂt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
===
But it hurtÂs my JoeyÂs Apple.
 Okay, for the last time. ItÂs not named for each individual man.
===
 YouÂve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I canÂt believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I canÂt believe that you would have a tux thatÂs thirty years old! 
===
ItÂs older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh! 
===
 Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! SheÂs coming!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! 
===
Heyyy!! You got the door open!! 
Hey-hey are you drunk?
===
Nooo!  Okay.  Whoa!  Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning  thirty.  So the bus boys took me out for some drinks.  I wanna puke on you later!
formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
===
Noo!!!
Yes!
===
Noo!!
Yes!!
===
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
Okay, hereÂs the thing. WeÂre gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youÂre drunk.
===
Really?! You promise?
Yeah, IÂll take care of it.
===
Okay. I love you so much. 
 Okay we have to do something about your breath.
===
breath?! 
ThatÂs still yours. Okay, now remember itÂs a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
===
Okay. I can do that.
Okay.
===
Yay!
See?  Here we go. 
===
 Paul!
 Phil.
===
Phil!
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  Okay,  youÂre doing great. YouÂre doing great. YouÂre doing fine.
===
Hey, whatÂs going on?
MonicaÂs a little drunk.
===
AwwwwwÂ 
 Go change!  She doesnÂt want her parents to know sheÂs drunk.
===
WhatÂs-whatÂs going on? PhilÂs really pissed!
MonicaÂs wasted.
===
Maybe that will liven up this party.
 Okay, will you just go help her change please!
===
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.  
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
===
Okay.  Happy birthday Grandma! ItÂs better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  All our love Monica and Chandler.  ThatÂs funny, yeah!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
===
 No, I know! I get it! ItÂs funny!
No, because youÂre not a grandmother!
===
 Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
 How are you feeling?
===
 Speech! Speech! LetÂs hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Pheebs!!
===
Oh-ho, I think itÂs nice.
I think itÂs necessary. 
===
Oh man!
What?
===
 Lift!! And slide!
Okay, here we go.
===
 I donÂt like this anymore. 
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
===
Yeah, itÂs just yÂknowÂ
 Monica said wedding.
===
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
===
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Too?
===
Sorry, IÂm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. 
===
Oh!!
ThatÂs great!
===
And-and-and not only that, IÂm gettinÂ a new brain!!
in your personal life!
===
WouldnÂt you love to do it just once?! 
DonÂt do it.
===
What is that?
I think itÂs the dying cat parade.
===
It sounds like itÂs coming from across the street.
 Oh my God!
===
What?
YÂknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "YouÂre half Scottish right?"
===
Nooo!!
Yes!!
===
Do you want some shortbread? Eh thatÂs Scottish like you are.
thing from my Scottish heritage.
===
What?!
Well itÂs just my entire family was run out of Scotland byÂVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. 
===
How did you know about that?!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
===
Were you the ones called the cops?!
ThatÂs not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just donÂt feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
===
Why not?
Because we hate them.
===
Come on thatÂs not fair! I mean you havenÂt even heard me play!
heard you play.
===
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
You mean the spitter?
===
Come on! It wasnÂt that bad!
Easy for you to say; youÂll be wearing a veil.
===
All right, what about the third guy?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
===
Can you blame him?
Sorry, I just donÂt like the idea of when I say, "I do," heÂs thinking, "Yeah, IÂd do her too!"
===
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah!
===
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
===
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
===
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
===
Well then let me do it!
JoeÂ
===
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wonÂt be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. ItÂll be me! And I swear IÂll do a really good job. Plus, yÂknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
 YÂknow, we havenÂt found anybody else.
===
So I can do it?
Yeah you can do it.
===
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Yeah.
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! 
Hey!
===
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Our ministerÂ
===
Anyway, I started working on what IÂm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Okay.
===
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft soÂ  "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."  Eh?  "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."  "We too can share and love and have and receive."
 Should we call the spitter?
===
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah. O-okay.
===
Yes!
See Joe, not that thatÂs not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! YÂknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
===
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
No, not usÂ  Us! 
===
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yÂknow, romantic stories. Nice stories.
===
"Âby doinÂ it."
Joe?
===
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing yÂknow youÂre in the bathtub together and sheÂs feeding you strawberries?
IsnÂt that what happened with you and the brideÂs maid?
===
Yeah baby!
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
===
Oh.
But then later that nightÂ
===
 Cute PJÂs! YouÂre really livinÂ it up here in London huh?
Well I wasÂ I was exactly expecting company afterÂ 9:15.
===
 Is Joey here?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the brideÂs maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youÂre not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
===
Really?
You kidding? YouÂre the most beautiful woman in most roomsÂ   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! WhatÂs going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
===
Well, not anymore.
But we donÂt do that.
===
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
===
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
 ThatÂs the perfect amount!
===
 YÂknow whatÂs weird?
What?
===
This doesnÂt feel weird!
I know.
===
YouÂre a really good kisser.
Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?
===
Hm-hmm!
Okay!
===
Wow! You are really fast!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
===
WeÂre gonna see each other naked.
Yep!
===
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Count of three?
===
One!
Two!
===
Three! 
Well I think itÂs safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
===
Eh, we werenÂt that close anyway!
Eh!
===
Hey!
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-eÂ 
===
Oh, dude IÂm so sorry!
No! No! No!
===
Hey no-no-no-no! ItÂs cool! ItÂs cool! I-IÂll only be a second, IÂm still with my brideÂs maid, I justÂWhere are those condoms you brought?
TheyÂre in my bag over there. 
===
Ah. 
Uh, could you leave me one?
===
 For just you?
Yeah.
===
Hey listen, why donÂt you come downstairs with me? ThereÂs some really nice girls down there.
No I-I-IÂm fine.
===
What?!
What?
===
 What?!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
===
No because it-it didnÂt seem important.
Oh, itÂs not important? ItÂs not important?! If it wasnÂt for a brideÂs maid youÂd be marrying him  not me!
===
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receivÂ
I donÂt believe it. The most romantic night of my life and IÂm runner up.
===
Hey!  Now IÂm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
 Look there is no way youÂre doing this wedding now. Okay?
===
What?! ThatÂs not fair! ItÂs not my fault! I was off with my brideÂs maid! And whoÂs to say I wouldÂve even said yes?!  I mean I wouldÂve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Okay, itÂs just weird! Okay? I donÂt want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needÂI donÂt know what I need. I need a walk.
===
Hey.
Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
===
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the weddingÂ
===
No-hey-no! If you donÂt want me to do it, I except that. I donÂt care about that. I justÂI donÂt want you to be upset.
fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
===
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! YouÂre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, Âcause you guys are perfect for each other. YÂknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it justÂit-it fits. YÂknow? And you just know itÂs gonna last forever.
ThatÂs what you should say.
===
What?
When youÂre marrying us; thatÂs what you should say.
===
Really? I can do it?
IÂd love it if you would do it.
===
Hey! 
words!
===
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
===
Food? Uh-huh gimme! 
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that weÂre trying to get to play at the wedding?
===
Since when are you into swing music?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
===
Chandler.
commercial.  So did you book them? Did you call?
===
I will.
Do you want me to call?
===
What is your job?
Staying out of the way.
===
 Well hello! SheÂs cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Sure! ThatÂs one of the great things about being engaged. IÂm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
===
YÂknow actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.  Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! 
 Smooth.
===
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying sheÂd like to go out again.
Huh.
===
 Hey Chandler!
Hey!
===
Listen, sorry I didnÂt stop by last night but I had a date.
Uh Joe, when itÂs one oÂclock in the morning and you donÂt come by? ThatÂs okay!
===
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Really? Right across the street?
===
Yeah!
WhenÂd you meet her?
===
Two days ago.
Excellent! YÂknow Ross met somebody too!
===
 Hey.
Hi! HowÂd it go?
===
Oh great! WeÂre going out again Saturday. But I just found sheÂs also seeing some other guy.
 Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in RossÂs situation?
===
Well you shouldnÂt be. Believe me I wouldnÂt want to be the guy whoÂs up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose!
So this is nice! I wish I didnÂt have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, whatÂs the name the girl youÂre dating?
===
Kristen Lang.
Bye! 
===
for that to work.
 What are you guys talking about?
===
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now IÂm not saying that thereÂs any connection here yÂknow, but they did tell me thatÂs why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!
===
Yeah but the Swing Kings? YÂknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsÂThey just stop living.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And thereÂs another reason too.
===
Well, what is the other reason?
I donÂt want to say.
===
Well you have to because maybe itÂs stupid.
Well itÂs just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasÂthe first time I knew thatÂyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
===
 DonÂt come in here!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
===
No! We only mess around at his place!
YÂknow itÂs funny I started it but, now itÂs scary me. So could you come out here please?
===
No, IÂm wearing a wedding dress.
Oh you got a wedding dress? ThatÂs great!
===
Yeah but IÂm not keeping it.
Well then why canÂt I see it?
===
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you canÂt like it.
Okay I promise. IÂll-IÂll hate it.  Wow! You-you lookÂhideous.
===
Really?
Yeah, thatÂs like the most ugliest dress IÂve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
===
Oh because it doesnÂtÂreally fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh thatÂs great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean itÂs like yuck! ItÂs terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
===
Okay! But you canÂt rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Okay!
===
 Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?  Guys?
 I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
===
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
===
YouÂre wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Kinda. TheyÂre really big.
===
DoesnÂt it ever just freak you out that-that youÂre never gonna be with anybody new again?
What?
===
Just, I love you so much. JustÂItÂs just sometimes it bothers me that IÂm never gonna have that feeling. YÂknow when you meet someone for the first time and itÂs new and exciting? YÂknow that rush?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody itÂs uh itÂs mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
===
Okay, but all right youÂre a guy, does it not freak you that youÂre never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and IÂm afraid even more sweating.
===
Even with me?
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
===
Really?
Well yeah! But now that I know that youÂre having these thoughts, IÂm back to panic, anxiety, and uh IÂm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
===
Come here! Come here!  Sweetie you donÂt have to worry. No, besides yÂknow what? IÂm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkidÂ
 Water! Water! Water!
===
Hey!
YÂknow IÂm-IÂm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
===
Oh boy me too!
YÂknow I was thinking if we had aÂa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hoursÂ
===
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
===
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
ThatÂs me! Come on!
===
Okay.  But wait, we canÂt. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, weÂre supposed to have lunch.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
===
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
 Hi! Nice to meet you!
===
 Chandler!
IÂll be right with you.
===
What?! Chandler sheÂs our cousin!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. ItÂs called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.
===
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
===
 Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
===
Well-wellÂsee? Parents are cominÂ!
YÂknow I think we should invite them.
===
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Well this is just sad!
===
 So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if thereÂs anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all.  But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Well, thanks a lot for hookinÂ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
===
IÂm MonicaÂs maid of honor. Okay? DonÂt try to blue pin me!
 Well, whatÂs the deal with these? These-these look nice.
===
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when theyÂre done with them they just send Âem back.
You mean like for award shows?
===
Some of them.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
===
Umm, well letÂs see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Not bad.
===
 This one is uh Paul OÂNeil.
WhoÂs that?
===
Uh-huh.
Are you serious?
===
Yeah.
007?! This is James BondÂs tux?!
===
Yeah.
Oh, I have to get married in James BondÂs tux!
===
ItÂs a pretty cool tux.
Oh, itÂs not just that, I would be EnglandÂs most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestyÂs secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?
===
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! 
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
===
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, BatmanÂs tux!
What?
===
ThatÂs right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmÂthat Batman film he was in.
You canÂt wear that! IÂm wearing the famous tux! James BondÂs tux!
===
So?
SoÂIf you wear that youÂll make mine less special.
===
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Look, itÂs my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
===
When I got married you slept with my sister.
was pretty 007.
===
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
===
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Batman has a utility belt!
===
007 has a fancy car!
Batman has the Batmobile!
===
007 gets all the ladies.
right?
===
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and IÂll make you a nice martini.
Actually, I donÂt like martinis.
===
with a funny straw?
Ooh, yum! 
===
Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why donÂt we put them on? YÂknow get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
I would but mine doesnÂt fit. The pants are a little tight.
===
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Well, does that mean that youÂre not going to wearing yours?
===
What are you kidding? ItÂs BatmanÂs tux!!
 Let me try it on!
===
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettinÂ in there.
 Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  WhatÂs this?
===
What?
premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnÂt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
===
Let me see that!  Oh man!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. 
===
 Oh.
Well, youÂre welcome. And tell them weÂre really glad theyÂre coming.
===
timeÂs the charm.  Aww, look at you all handsome!
Whose is it?
===
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Whose is it?
===
I donÂt want to say.
Oh, come on! I donÂt care! Come on! Whose is it?
===
Do you realize that four weeks from today weÂre getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Do you realize you get louder each week?
===
ThereÂs still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I figured IÂd buy those. Pat, IÂd like to buy a vow. 
===
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
===
No! But I know exactly what IÂm going to say.
Do you happen to know what IÂm going to say?
===
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
IÂm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldÂve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
===
Well, why donÂt you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I 
Yeah, IÂm not sure I can do that.
===
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
 Okay.
===
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
 There are seven?!  ThatÂs one?
===
ItÂs kind of an important one!
Oh, yÂknow-yÂknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
===
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "MonicaÂ
 MonicaÂ
===
"Âwhen I look back over our time togetherÂ"
 Yeah?
===
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
You'll get one.
===
Oh yeah? When?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
===
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
===
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
===
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
 Uh, uh.
===
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! 
===
Wait, wait, wait! 
Look, MonicaÂ
===
Look! 
This is not going to work.
===
I bet this will work! 
You are so great! I love you!
===
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
===
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
===
Yes, you did!
No I didn't!
===
You love me!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
===
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
===
Then youÂd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnÂt make any sense.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂm saying?
===
ChandlerÂ In all my lifeÂ I never thought I would be so lucky.  As toÂfall in love with my bestÂmy bestÂ ThereÂs a reason why girls donÂt do this!
Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it!Â  Oh God, I thoughtÂ  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if youÂll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?
===
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
===
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
===
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
===
 I can't wait to be with you!Â  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
 Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? 
===
Bye Chandler!   I miss you already. 
 Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
===
Actually, I did!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
===
messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! SoÂ
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
===
She's bluffing!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! 
===
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
===
Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.
 It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
===
You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
===
Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
===
And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
===
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
===
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Who are those people?
===
Hey.
WhatÂs going on?
===
Oh thatÂs so sweet.
So we both finished our vows.
===
Chandler!!
DonÂt worry honey, weÂll make yours funnier.
===
 I have never known love like this.
You really like it?
===
Dude! How-how did you write this?
I stole MonicaÂs and changed the name.
===
Chandler, we still havenÂt gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thatÂs because I didnÂt send him an invitation.
===
Chandler! HeÂs your father; he should be at the wedding.
I donÂt even know the man. Okay? WeÂre not the close. I havenÂt seen him in years.
===
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnÂt even asked?!
Well he doesnÂt have to know! ItÂs not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
===
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Trust me, you donÂt want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
===
Here! 
WhatÂs this?
===
ItÂs your suitcase. WeÂre going to Las Vegas.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersÂThink of the money weÂll save!!  WeÂre not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
===
WeÂre going to Las Vegas to see your dad. ItÂs time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
YÂknow we already went over this and I won!
===
No you didnÂt. Oh and honey just so you know, now that youÂre marrying me, you donÂt get to win anymore.
Look forget it okay? I donÂt want to go. I donÂt want to see him. I donÂt wanna.
===
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? ThatÂs a, thatÂs a pretty great dad.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
===
WhoÂs Mr. Girabaldi?
Does it matter?!
===
Chandler, youÂre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe itÂs time that you let that stuff go. If your fatherÂs not at your weddingÂyouÂre gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Yeah o-okay, but IÂm just doing this for you.
===
Yes!
So I really never get to win anymore?
===
 Hm-mmm?
Yeah, I just ordered a beer! 
===
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
No! No! I donÂt want him to know weÂre yet! IÂm not sure IÂm ready for that. And besides heÂs not gonna be too happy to see me either.
===
Why not?!
I donÂt know if IÂve told you this, but heÂs kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
===
Hello darlings.
And thereÂs daddy!
===
canÂt be your father.
Believe me, IÂve been saying that for years. Oh my God!
===
What?
ThatÂs Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
===
No-no I heard! IÂm just sorry.
It canÂt happen like this. Okay? IÂll meet you back at the hotel.
===
So whatÂs your name?
 Chandler. 
===
We? 
I know it would make me happy, maÂam.
===
 You okay?
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
===

 When I was growing up IÂplayed the one on the far left.
===
Why?! WhatÂs happening to the coffee house?!  Oh! 
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
===
Old?
The young hot ball and chain.
===
 YÂknow what? Actually IÂm kinda glad theyÂre leaving Âcause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
WhatÂs up?
===
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. IÂm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
===
Not for the next few minutes.
During this timeÂare you, are you still my best man?
===
Nope.
Do I still call you Ross?
===
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnÂt be more thrilled for both of you, but as MonicaÂs older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass!  What? IÂm-IÂm-IÂm serious!  ComeÂHey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? IÂm-IÂm not kidding here!
 Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
===
No problem.
So are weÂfriends again?
===
Yeah.
what MonicaÂs older brother just said to me!
===
Honey, we gotta go!
 Okay. HereÂs a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
===
 I donÂt have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Yes, include more people in this.
===
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow weÂll be getting married?
tomorrow night.
===
I just, I canÂt believe that we made it!
Well you donÂt have to sound so surprised.
===
IÂm sorry butÂnothing.
What?
===
WellÂhonestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Honestly? Me too.
===
Really?
Yeah. YÂknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and IÂll go allÂChandler. But nothing has.
===
Ohh, IÂm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean itÂs really, itÂs made me stay calm.  I coulda been worse!
Okay. IÂll be right there.
===
Hey Maureen!  Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
WeÂre the Bings.
===
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Mr. and Mrs. Bing! 
===
Chandler!
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.  
===
 Hello all!
HiÂdad.
===
DonÂt you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Oh my God! 
===
So this is your office?
How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldÂve hid at the gym!
===
What the hell are you doing?!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that IÂm related to Monica. How is she?
===
SheÂs fine. She doesnÂt know youÂre gone. And she doesnÂt have to know, okay? Now come on, weÂre going home.
No! No! No! I canÂt do that!
===
Why not?!
Because if I go home, weÂre gonna become the Bings! I canÂt be the Bings!
===
WhatÂs wrong with being the Bings?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
===
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
No.
===
Then you are neither of your parents!
ItÂs not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodyÂs! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And IÂve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I donÂt race cars! I donÂt make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
===
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
I want to. I love her so much, but IÂm afrÂItÂs too huge.
===
YÂknow, okay. YouÂre right. It is huge. So why donÂt we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Well yeah, but thenÂ
===
 YeahÂNo-but-but-but-but! WeÂre just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thatÂs not scary right?
Depends on what you mean by we.
===
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasnÂt so scary, was it?
No.
===
IÂm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Yeah okay. Well, whatÂs the next little bit?
===
Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like youÂve done everything else!
Yeah. YouÂre right. Hey I-I can do that.
===
Yeah.
Okay, excuse me for a minute. 
===
WhÂHeyÂWhoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
===
Okay.
Okay.
===
 There he is!!
What?
===
YouÂre not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Ross! 
===
Hiiii-Ya!!  IÂm serious! YouÂre not walking out on my sister!
 ThatÂs right! IÂm not!
===
Then where the hell have you been?!
I know about Monica.
===
What?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
===
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
You donÂt know?
===
What? YouÂll hi-ya?
MonicaÂs pregnant.
===
Oh my God. Oh my God! And youÂre-youÂreÂyouÂre not freaking out?
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettesÂ
===
Cigarettes?!!
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and thatÂs when I uh, saw this.  New York.) Yeah, yÂknow what? I thought anything that can fit into this, canÂt be scary.
===
Well you obviously didnÂt see Chucky 3.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so sheÂd know I was okay.
===
Oh look at you! So handsome!
You look beautiful mom.  You look beautiful too dad. I love you both.  IÂm so glad you here. 
===
Are you Chandler?
Are you Joey?
===
Not now.
Okay.
===
I am Father Kalebasous.
 HeÂs Greek Orthodox.
===
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
I do.
===
What baby?
Our baby.
===
We have a baby?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
===
I didnÂt take a pregnancy test.
ThenÂwho did?
===
Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didnÂt. I did.
Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. 
===
Are you saying that you donÂt want to get with this?
You see, I donÂt sayÂ
===
Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
===
Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?!  Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
WhoÂs the father?
===
Why?!
Why not?
===
Okay, okay. ItÂs James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbara StreisandÂs husband James Brolin?
===
How about just the bridemaids?
YÂknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
===
Honey, IÂm going to put my hand in your pocket!
No?
===
No.
IÂve been taking dancing lessons.
===
What?!
Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
===
Oh that is so sweet!
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
===
WhatÂs the matter?
I donÂt know, itÂs these new shoes, theyÂre all slippery.
===
Well, are you going to be able to do this?
Not well.
===
Congratulations.
Thank you.
===
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
===
Well, itÂs a funny story.
Funny: ha-ha or funny: 
===
Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ÂCause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldÂve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thatÂs just for ugly people.
What size shoes do you wear?
===
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
===
Uh, I donÂt even really know where I left those. Sorry.
 Those arenÂt eleven and a half.
===
No-no! No! No! You donÂt tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks IÂm a soap actor.
just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
===
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Did it turn into sand?
===
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youÂll be fine. 
 No. No, I wonÂt. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnÂt want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
===
Chandler, IÂm gonna have you arrested.
Why?
===
 ThatÂs right. IÂm no longer a bride. IÂll never be a bride again. Now, IÂm just someoneÂs wife!
And IÂm the happiest guy in the world!  Oh honey, come on donÂt be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
===
Oh yeah, right. 
We got the honeymoon.
===
ThatÂs not Âtil Thursday.
The wedding pictures?
===
They wonÂt be ready for weeks.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
===
ThatÂs true!  I knew I married you for a reason!
IÂll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
===
Nothing! It was something.
Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
===
Are you joking? Check out is not Âtil noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left.
Oh.
===
Hi.
Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
===
Why not? ItÂs built into the price of the room.
Yeah but you donÂt needÂÂWhat is this?
===
Thread!
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
===
What disposable cameras?
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
===
No you didnÂt.
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I saidÂ
===
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"  Yeah, then you did that.
So you donÂt have the cameras?!
===
No. Sorry man.
So? What? What? TheyÂre gone! MonicaÂs gonna freak!
===
Well, IÂm sure theyÂre still somewhere here in the hotel. IÂll-IÂll help you look for them.
Great.
===
Chandler?
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
===
No. Did you?
Yes! And thatÂs why IÂm under the table. Celebrating.
===
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-oneÂs turned them.
Well this is great. YÂknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheÂs really depressed.
===
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canÂt believe I screwed this up!
===
IÂm sorry man.  HereÂs a thought. This is the same ballroom. ThereÂs a band. ThereÂs gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
===
No-no-no, IÂm saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseÂs faces.
Are you serious?
===
IÂm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Marriage advice? Really?!
===
IÂm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! ArenÂt these the same flowers?
I donÂt know, Monica picked out the flowers.
===
What about the chairs?
She picked those out too.
===
How about the place settings?
That was her.
===
What did you do?
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
===
Uh, would you take one of us?
UhhÂ Yeah sure.  Click!
===
Why wonÂt you take our picture?
Oh yeah. IÂll take, IÂll take your picture. 
===
Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
===
Well go! Go move it! 
Okay, you ready for the last picture?
===
Yeah.
Get ready to run.  Congratulations on your wedding. 
===
Great! WeÂre hanginÂ in the kitchen!  LetÂs stay in the kitchen!
ItÂs picture time.
===
Wow! That is a great picture!
Eh?
===
Huh, didnÂt see that coming.
Okay, so this isnÂt a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withÂwith this lady. Which by the look on your face IÂm sure youÂll remember. So we donÂt needÂÂThereÂs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
===
That would be a good idea.
Okay.  You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
===
You kissed another woman!
Call it even?!
===
Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
IÂd better go pack.
===
Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
 What?! I didnÂt even know thatÂWhy didnÂt you tell me?!  Why am I talking like this?!
===
I didnÂt think you could keep it a secret.
 What?!  I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
===
What secrets?
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
===
 YouÂll tell me later?
You already know.
===
TheyÂre kissing letÂs just go around them.
Oh honey, leave them alone, theyÂre in love.
===
 Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! LetÂs act like weÂre on our honeymoon.
on our honeymoon.
===
You see, if weÂd gone around them like I said, weÂShe wouldÂve given us those tickets. Damnit!
25J and K, any chance those arenÂt together?
===
Look at that! Look at that! TheyÂre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No.
===
Me neither! We have to get in! 
Just act like you belong.
===
Oh my God! Oranges!
Shh!  Nice to see you again. 
===
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
Yes, of course. 
===
IÂm sorry, would you move your thumb? I canÂt see the seat number.
Oh thatÂs all right, I have it memorized. ItÂs 1A.
===
 Sir, this is not a first class ticket. IÂm sorry.
Apology accepted. Excuse us. 
===
I canÂt believe weÂre here.
Oh youÂve got to be kidding me.
===
Who are you?
WeÂre you just ten seconds later!
===
Well you can have the suite if you want. We donÂt care about where we stay. WeÂre here to celebrate our love together. We donÂt have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
 We need the stuff.
===
What? Are you serious?!  Joey smells gas!
What else is new?
===
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
TheyÂre terrific, and they live right here in the city.
===
Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
IÂm sorry, weÂre just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
===
Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck!  Hi Greg, IÂm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chanceÂ
===
YÂknow what? Why donÂt you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
We reallyÂdidnÂt get a chance toÂ
===
Oh great! 
Ross! ItÂs got your wavy black lines!
===
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
YÂknow who has a great video camera?
===
Do you still wanna call Âem? I wanna call Âem.
LetÂs call Âem.
===
 Uh sorry, wrong number. 
Here you go. 
===
They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
I donÂt know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
===
Regina Philange. 
I still donÂt get it, we didnÂt do anything wrong.
===
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
===
 Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! 
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
===
What about my questions?
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
===
Oh, IÂm sorry. Was that another joke?
 Was that another question?
===
 Not on the ones we sent out.
So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! 
===
You used the Europe story!
ThatÂs the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
===
 Hello Greg?  Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5Â   That is their old number! JennyÂs been giving it out since they moved!
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
===
Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
===
YouÂre a joker Bing. 
WhatÂs funny about that?
===
 Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Hey thatÂs okay. So, where do you want to go?
===
Yeah!
Again?!
===
IÂm telling you, I like the food!
display!  Hey Bob.
===
Did that guy just call you Toby?
Yeah, he thinks thatÂs my name.
===
Well, why donÂt you correct him?
Oh itÂs been going on way to long now. YÂknow, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnÂt say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now itÂs five years later, the donutÂs gone and IÂm still Toby.
===
Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
No! That would be so awkward! LookÂBesides, we work in different departments. HeÂs on the sixth floor yÂknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while. WhatÂs the big deal? It could be worse, itÂs not like heÂs calling me Muriel. 
===
Hey! HowÂs my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, IÂll ask.
===
Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
Yeah!
===
Oh then you know each other.
WeÂre on a semi-first name basis.
===
What do you think of adding him to our team?
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I donÂt know if he has what it takes.
===
Really? They love him down on six.
But this is eleven. ItÂs almost twice as hard up here.
===
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
I think itÂs best sir.
===
But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. IÂve got a stack of documents on my desk this high.  
YÂknow what you should do, just toss Âem in the shedder and claim you never got Âem.
===
 ThatÂs a good one. 
around here?!
===
Hey Toby, you got a sec?
Sure, whatÂs up?
===
Hey Toby!
Hey Bobby.
===
ItÂs Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler 
Uhh yeah. Yeah, itÂs  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
===
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Okay Bob listen uhh, IÂm the reason you didnÂt get the job up here.
===
Toby donÂt.
Bob!
===
Toby! IÂm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
===
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone youÂre notÂ
YouÂre an actor!
===
No, itÂs me. Phoebe!
 Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costumeÂ
===
Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
===
Yes I did! IÂm Chandler.  Dude, what happened?
How is that me?
===
 That is so you!
When have I ever done that?!
===
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?  Well, IÂm a potato or aÂspud. And these are my antennae.  So Sputnik, becomesÂ  Spud-nik. Spudnik!
Wow! I donÂt have the worst costume anymore!
===
Hey Mona!
Oh! Hi!
===
Hi!
JoeyÂs gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youÂd come by as a slutty nurse.
===
Umm, actually IÂm just a nurse.
YouÂd think that would embarrass me, but you see IÂm maxed out.
===
Yes!
 Marry her.
===
ThatÂs funny. Yeah. YÂknow youÂre the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Oh relax man, relax. YouÂre looking a little flushed.
===
 Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
What question?
===
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
ThereÂs no question.
===
Ross is really strong! Okay, heÂs the strongest out of all three of you!  Except for Joey.
I cannot believe you didnÂt pick me.
===
Uh, in her defense, sheÂs right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Oh really?! You think youÂre stronger? Why donÂt you prove it? 
===
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
 YouÂre going down.
===
 Look honey, you donÂt have to do this, okay? ItÂs the strength you have inside that means the most to me. YouÂre loyal, youÂre honest, and you have integrity! ThatÂs the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
That means nothing to me.  Come on!
===
Pride.
And dignity.
===
 So, you gettinÂ tired?
Nope! I can do this all day.
===
Yeah? Me too.  GettinÂ a little tired though.
God, IÂm exhausted.
===
Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, MonaÂs standing right over there.  Oh God, sheÂs talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
No way! If anything youÂve gotta let me win! My wife thinks IÂm a wimp!
===
Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockinÂ people up! And IÂm dressed as doody.
YouÂre Spudnik.
===
Come on, who are we kidding? IÂm doody. Please? SheÂs watchinÂ.
Fine.  Oh no! 
===
Look, I wanted to tell IÂm-IÂm sorry you lost.
Listen, IÂve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
===
 Is that a secret or a lie.
No, I let him winÂRoss!
===
Yeah?
Would you tell her I let you win please?
===
me win. No, ChandlerÂs really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! 
I am strong! IÂll show you! 
===
Chandler please!
Oh whatÂs the matter? Are you scared?
===
Hey.
Hey.
===
Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
YÂknow uh, I didnÂt actually do this.
===
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
No, it wasnÂt you.
===
Well then who?
I got a maid. Yay!
===
 I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning thenÂ
Uh honey, I know you donÂt like to relinquish controlÂ
===
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Look, sheÂs really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
===
Did she really say that?
Yes, I distinctly remember Âcause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
===
Fine, I can do it.  Whew.
WhatÂs the matter?
===
Okay. 
See? I told you.
===
She stole my jeans!
 What?
===
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
===
DonÂt you see? ItÂs the perfect crime!
She mustÂve been planning this for years!
===
I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Honey, isnÂt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
===
I guess.
So, shouldnÂt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we goÂsnooping around her crotch?
===
Fine. IÂm just glad I didnÂt give her my secret ingredient.
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
===
Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
How come?
===
Because I put my head between her legs.
To see her pants?
===
TheyÂre my pants!
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
===
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
===
Fine.  SheÂs wearing my bra!
Oh dear God!
===
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
recognize that youÂre crazy.
===
HereÂs the plan! Okay? IÂm going to leave you get a look at BrendaÂs bra!
HereÂs another planÂNo!
===
I would do it but she thinks IÂm attracted to her!
Why?
===
hear where my head was? Come on! Come on weÂre a team! WeÂre in this together!
I fear a jury will see it the same way!
===
Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womanÂs breasts all the time!
You see that?
===
Do you see this? 
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if itÂs not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
===
Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youÂll know itÂs mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, thereÂs a very noticeable rip.
You need new clothes.
===
 What are you doing?
IÂm leaning. This is where I lean.
===
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
Brenda a bee!
===
What?
Yes! ItÂs flown into your blouse and youÂd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
===
I think I know whatÂs going on here.
You do?
===
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but itÂs wrong. YouÂre married.
see your bra?
===
Oh my God!!! Monica!! HeÂs the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Her what?!!
===
bachelorette partyÂ
You had a bachelorette party?!
===
She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!
I thought we werenÂt gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! YÂknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
===
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnÂt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
You went home with the waitress.
===
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
===
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing! 
My God! You must be good in bed!
===
Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
SheÂs okay with Rachel and the baby?
===
Well IÂI havenÂt actually told her yet. I donÂt want to scare her off, yÂknow?
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youÂre going down the same path, but youÂre really going down different ones.
===
 Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youÂre gonna have a bachelor party.
What?
===
Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
Honey! ThatÂs crazy! I donÂt want you to get me a stripperÂ
===
Come on! Come on, itÂll be fun! ItÂll make me feel so much better.
Look, I appreciate it, but uh, itÂs a little creepy. YÂknow? IÂm not a bachelor anymore.
===
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
All right fine! But IÂm only doing this for you!
===
Yeah!
And Joey.
===
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
===
Uh actually, sorry I canÂt even make it. IÂm seeing Mona again tonight.
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
===
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
What are you doing?
===
Look, look letÂs pretend itÂs a real bachelor party. Okay? YÂknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itÂll be fun.
Okay. I canÂt believe tomorrowÂs the big day.
===
How does it feel knowing youÂre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youÂre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
YouÂre right, this is more fun.
===
Hi!
Hi. 
===
Uh, that-thatÂs-thatÂs me!
ThatÂs me.
===
So is that a bedroom? 
Yeah, yeah right over there.
===
All right, whenever youÂre ready. 
That was weird.
===
a stripper, but she got confused about what sheÂs supposed to do.
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  MaÂam, are you also a stripper?
===
Maybe MonicaÂs playing a joke on ya. YÂknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thatÂs pretty funny.
That is funny, maybe for my birthday sheÂll murder someone.
===
Do you mind if I smoke in here?
Oh actually, IÂd rather youÂYeah, go ahead. WeÂre gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
===
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Why would she do that?
===
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youÂre really bad at yÂknow, sexually?
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
===
In a minute!
 In a minute? WhatÂs gonna happen in a minute?!
===
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Why me?!
===
Hey! ItÂs your bachelor party.
should do it.
===
I donÂt want to. You do it!
You do it!
===
You do it!
All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?
===
I miss this.
I donÂt think weÂve actually done this before!
===
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Well weÂwe still hang out.
===
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. YÂknow now itÂs likeÂthings are different.
Well yÂknow, things are different. IÂmÂIÂm married now.
===
Oh sureÂAnd hey, donÂt get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I justÂI missÂhanging outÂjust-just us, yÂknow?
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on weÂll make time to hang out with each other.
===
I swear I didnÂt know she was a hooker! I mean whÂDid you let her smoke in here?
Her ass print is still on your grandmotherÂs quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
===
YÂknow what? IÂm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and youÂre gonna get a stripper. 
Monica! Wait!
===
What?
 Carry on.
===
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think IÂll take them off. 
Could you not narrate?
===
Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.   So howÂs the game?
I have no idea.
===
What?
Yeah! IÂm just pretending to watch the game so I donÂt have to help out with stuff.
===
I donÂt believe you! That isÂbrilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV. 
===
Is your team winning hon?
Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  ThereÂs no Anderson.
===
Hey.
Oh hey. IÂd shake your hand but uh; IÂm really into the game. Plus, I think itÂd be better for my ego if we didnÂt stand right next to each other.
===
Well you look incredible too! YouÂre justÂyouÂre so fit!
IÂm watching the game, but IÂm not deaf!
===
Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, IÂm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something?  No Will no!
 YÂknow, itÂs been a while since weÂve screamed something. Maybe we should.
===
Oh okay.
Oh come on!
===
Okay, dinnerÂs ready!
Good game!
===
Yeah.
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
===
 Green Bay.
 Detroit.
===
Everyone at our school heard it!
Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
===
Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
IÂm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
===
Hey! She didnÂt look 50!
Did she look 16?
===
She didnÂt photograph well!
Well, she probably wasnÂt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
===
Well Joey, weÂre allÂweÂre all very proud of you.
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
===
Hey! So what do you think?
New haircut?  Necklace?  Dress?  Boots?  Boots!
===
Yes! Now, theyÂre a little more than I normally spend on bootsÂor rent 
Oh my God!
===
I know.
IÂm gonna miss being able to afford food.
===
IÂm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
She had a point.  
===
TheyÂre mine!
Yeah well, too bad weÂre gonna have to return them.
===
Honey, IÂm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but IÂm going to wear them all the time. YouÂll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
I have you.
===
Hey guys!
Hey-hey.
===
See Chandler? IÂm getting a lot of use out of them already! TheyÂre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pantsÂ
You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. 
===
 Hey!
 Hey!
===
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from schoolÂ
 I donÂt think you did a very thorough job!
===
 Ahhhhhhhh!
 WhatÂs wrong?
===
Oh nothing IÂm justÂjust was yawning. 
Oh donÂt forget, my office holiday party is tonight. 
===
Honey, we donÂt really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Now sweetie, I know you donÂt like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has aÂsupple leather lining.
===
I-I donÂt-I donÂt think that IÂm gonna wear the boots tonight.
Why not?
===
Well yÂknow, IÂm just-IÂm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
===
Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots donÂt really go with it.
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
===
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, IÂll wear the boots. In fact, IÂll go into my room right now and yÂknow try the outfit on.
Okay.
===
Oh no, we canÂt walk!
What honey, itÂs like fifteen blocks to the subway. LetÂs go.
===
Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
WhatÂs going on?
===
I canÂt walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
What?
===
Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! TheyÂre killing me! One toe at a time!
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  ItÂs oddly unsettling.
===
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Hop on.
===
Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  AhÂOohÂOohhÂOhhÂOh GodÂOhhÂOhÂOhhÂOhhhhÂ
Honey, I know youÂre in pain right now, but IÂm a little turned on.
===
 Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh IÂm sorry! Do you need a break?
===
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
I can see it from right here. ItÂll cost you one husband.
===
Okay, IÂm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
 I donÂt have your boots.
===
Well I donÂt have them either. Where are they?
Well, why donÂt you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
===
Okay.  God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
===
Okay, IÂm never gonna wear them again. I just didnÂt get a chance to say goodbye.
YÂknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
===
Okay.  All right.
Okay. 
===
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
===
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
I didnÂt know you and Carol were getting divorced, IÂm  sorry.
===
Okay, IÂll see you tomorrow!  Just so you know,  weÂre not seeing him tomorrow.  I-I cannot spend another  evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
No.
===
ThatÂs because he wasnÂt invited because of the way he behaved  at our engagement party.
through an ice sculpture  doesnÂt it?
===
Bing! WeÂre all set for tonight, 8 oÂclock.
Oh uh, as it turns out, we canÂt do it. Monica has to work.
===
Oh, my ex-wife didnÂt work, unless you call turning into her mother  work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
Oh uh well tomorrowÂs no good for her either.
===
Oh? Why not?
ItÂs the semi-finalsÂof herÂbotchy ball tournament.
===
WhatÂs going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or  something?
Well now-now youÂre just talking crazy.
===
So why canÂt the three of us go out together?
Because uhÂwe-weÂwe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold  me.
===
Good God Bing IÂwell I canÂt say IÂm altogether surprised,  I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at  me, pure lust.
YÂknow what would really help me through this tough time is  choking something. Can I choke ya?
===
Bing my boy, weÂre gonna get you over this. Now hereÂs the plan,  grab your coat, weÂre going to a strip club.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with  that bitch.
===
Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap  dance with those girls. Huh?
Oh thatÂs all right sir, and thatÂs just one girl.
===
No, itÂs a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. WeÂre gonna go  to the East River right now and throw it in there!
Oh no-no-no!
===
From the tequila factory?
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that  you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then  when I wouldnÂt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
===
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday  card this year?
Ooh, I donÂt know if weÂre there yet.
===
Hey! I got you a present!!
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
===
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got  here!
Pheebs you didnÂt have to get us anything for our wedding you  already sangÂ
===
Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Oh, okay. 
===
All right. 
I kinda like it here.
===
Well I-I really donÂt remember the name of it.
Well what did it do?
===
Well, you justÂyou put a quarter in and yÂknow pull-pull some  handles and win like a candy bar or something.
A vending machine?
===
Chandler! PhoebeÂs hogging the game!
Who cares? ItÂs a stupid game.
===
You only think itÂs stupid because you suck at it.
I donÂt suck. ItÂs sucks. You suck.
===
No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why donÂt you  go home and wait for the thank you card?
Why do you want to play this game so bad?
===
Hey.
You are not going to believe what I did today!
===
Well it clearly wasnÂt showering or shaving.
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They  should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they donÂt.
===
What is the matter with your hand?
Well IÂve been playing it for like eight hours, itÂll loosen  up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyÂre dirty  words.
===
Chandler, why would you do that?
Because itÂs awesome.
===
You think this is clever?
Well yÂknow, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it  is a bit of a challenge.
===
Hey wait a minute, this one isnÂt dirty.
It is when you put it together with that one.
===
Ah, well if you donÂt clear this off, you wonÂt be getting one  of those from me. But BenÂs coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this  canÂt be there.
Come on, he wonÂt even know what they mean.
===
Chandler! HeÂs seven; heÂs not stupid.
Have you talked to him lately?
===
All right, look IÂm just gonna unplug it.
No-no-no, if you unplug it, IÂll have nothing to show for my day!  It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look at  that! Look at that, itÂs still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM   Chip in it or something!
===
Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
With the claw?!
===
All right fine. Fine, IÂll do it. IÂve just got to get this  off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
 Pull my fingerÂÂMy hand is  messed up.
===
Chandler sucks! He couldnÂt have gotten this good!
I did.  But it came at a price.
===
But Ben is coming over tonight and he canÂt see this.
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
===
I know!
One more score to go! You can do it! 
===
DonÂt touch her!!
All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
===
 No. 
Hey Pheebs, whatÂs up?
===
OkayÂOop! Too late! IÂm leaving! Come on Chandler letÂs go! 
Well, Phoebe I thought IÂdÂÂYeah, what the hell. 
===
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they donÂt like us do they? 
Who says you canÂt get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
===
No, it doesnÂt say where it came from. Where would we return it?
How about to the street say from the balcony?
===
Why donÂt we just find a place for it?
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
===
No! ThatÂs where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
How about the closet by the bathroom? 
===
Oh, okay. Here, why donÂt you let me do it?
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  ItÂs locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
===
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Oh yÂknow, IÂve been living here a while and IÂve never seen whatÂs inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
===
Feminine stuff.
DonÂt try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
===
Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youÂll let it go.
Fine.
===
Thank you! 
 Love you.
===
 Hello Chandler, lovely day huh?  You!
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.  If! I said, "If it helps!" 
===
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Monica has a secret closet and she wonÂt let me see whatÂs in it.
===
Why not?
I donÂt know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I canÂt see?!
===
I donÂt know. Ooh, I bet itÂs Richard.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
===
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe sheÂs having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
And here we goÂ
===
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Yeah.  Oh no wait, IÂm not an nine-year-old girl.
===
Then why do you throw like one?
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
===
Sure. "Monica."
So, howÂs the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
===
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I justÂI wish I didnÂt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yÂknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkÂI think Ross feels left out. YÂknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. GodÂ You shouldÂve seen the look on RossÂs face.  By the way, I have no idea what IÂm doing here. For all I know IÂm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
ThatÂs a good idea.
===
Yeah.
Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
===
Oh, I justÂI feel terrible.
Well, itÂs not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? YÂknow? YouÂre doing nothing wrong.  Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if youÂre in there, could you pass me my credit card?
===
  How did you get in there?!
 YouÂre messy.
===
Oh no! You werenÂt supposed to see this!
I married Fred Sanford!
===
Really? You promise you wonÂt tell anyone?
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
===
Hey.
So RachelÂs all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
===
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnÂt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, itÂs a couple weeks past itÂs expiration date, so itÂs got a bit of a kick.
Are you okay?
===
Oh-oh! Okay, sheÂs kicking!
Oh!  SheÂs growing inside you.
===
Whoa!!
Oh! 
===
Wow that was a big one.
I think thatÂs the youngest girl ever to reject me.
===
 Oh hey you guys!
Oh hey!
===
Uh-huh,  and you?
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I donÂt think they exist.
===
Okay, good.
Why?
===
Well last night, I met MonicaÂs.
What?
===
Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Come on, donÂt be crazy.  You donÂt think thereÂs someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? 
===
Of course, of course.
A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
===
Oh, itÂs so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Luckily, the guy she settled for canÂt hear what youÂre talking about.
===
Oh, IÂm so sorry. Um, and maybe IÂm wrong! I butÂyÂknow IÂm gonna go out with him again, IÂll find out more.
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youÂre still gonna date him?
===
 Soul mate.
 What?
===
Not really.
WhatÂs wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No?
===
Nothing! I swear to God I didnÂt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnÂt believe in soul mates. SoÂ
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
===
Âso IÂve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
Cheese you say? ThatÂs some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
===
Excuse me?
Cheese, itÂs smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
===
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, IÂve got a great little villa you can stay at.
Is it made of cheese?
===
IÂd move in tomorrow!
 Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?
===
IÂm so sorry.
What do we do?
===
IÂd like to have Don and Phoebe over. WouldnÂt that be nice?
Sure, why donÂt you set it up. IÂll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
===
Are you okay? YouÂve been acting weird all afternoon.
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
===
Jeez! What is with you?
IÂm sorry, did you say cheese?
===
All right, whatÂs going on?
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I donÂt believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wonÂt stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
===
Chandler, you donÂt believe in soul mates?
No. But IÂm sure  ÂtomatoesÂ does.
===
I donÂt believe in soul mates either.
You donÂt?
===
No. I donÂt think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
So youÂyou donÂt want to live with Don in a cheese house?
===
No, IÂve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
I love you.
===
I know.
YÂknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Is Joey here?
I donÂt see him.  Do you see him?
===
Sure.
What?! No! No!
===
I canÂt! YÂknow? You guys donÂt know what itÂs like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
 I donÂt know what thatÂs like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
===
Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on yourÂ
 We didnÂt play it!!
===
Okay, so when youÂre done with your tea IÂll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
I didnÂt know you read tea leaves.
===
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
What does yours say Pheebs?
===
So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but itÂs not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
I know itÂs tough now, but things will get better.
===
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we canÂt even be in the same room with each other?!
IÂm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
===
Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
LetÂs just say if I canÂt find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
===
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
In the James Taylor case.
===
Where is the James Taylor CD?
Honey, IÂm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
===
Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, weÂre just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Well, if weÂre gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. YÂknow alphabetically or by genre?
===
soundtrack? Really?
They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.
===
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him you had?
===
 I canÂt believe that you yelled at my boss! IÂm-IÂm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
You can always sell your baby.
===
ItÂs all gonna be okay. TheyÂre just so happy that IÂm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
is really going out of there way to show theyÂre not in the baby buying business.
===
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Oh IÂm sorry, youÂre kicking me out of my own living room?
===
Yeah.
IÂll be in there. 
===
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that?
===
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and itÂs always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year IÂm going to make them cry.
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
===
Oh IÂm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. 
ItÂs a dog.
===
ItÂs a dead dog. ThatÂs Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
ItÂs your parentsÂ anniversary and youÂre going to talk about their dead pet?
===
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too.
===
No, no, no wait! DonÂt tell me. Let me guess.  Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, IÂm sorry Phoebe didnÂt mention you.  Chandler, IÂm kidding all ready youÂre my favorite!
Ha!
===
Okay, I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents? 
Yeah.
===
What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room CÂI feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I donÂt want to forget this moment! ItÂs like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! 
I donÂt think the flash went off.
===
Come on!
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
===
Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit Âem. I canÂt wait. TheyÂre going to be crying so hard. TheyÂre going to be fighting for breath. 
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
===
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
there was something in your head to control the things you say. 
===
Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yÂknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I donÂt know, gal pal Rachel Green?
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
===
 You think weÂre being obvious?
No, weÂre just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. 
===
Uh, double latte, extra foam.
And a bagel with onlyÂ
===
Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Mento?
===
You too!
Thanks.
===
Oh cool!
ThatÂs great.
===
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day IÂll  Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night IÂll be  Joey Trrrribbiani!
YouÂll be perfect for this! ThatÂs already your name!
===
Awesome!
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
===
 All right! LetÂs play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?
===
 Yeah!
 No!
===
I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Well Joey, IÂm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! 
===
Excellent! LetÂs play Bamboozled! Chandler, youÂll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Bogota.
===
ItÂs Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
===
I should know that. LetÂs see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Higher or lower than what?
===
This is embarrassing. 
 Can you believe how lame this is?
===
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youÂre ready to answer the question.
This is ridiculous, heÂs not gonna hold his breathÂ 
===
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, TrisÂHoly cow, thatÂs a big word. TriscÂ Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
Let me see that.
===
This one right here. 
Triscadecaphobia.
===
Wait a minute, I-I believe IÂm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
This game makes no sense!
===
YÂknow what? YouÂre just upset because youÂre losing.
Oh come on Ross, I think weÂre all losers here.
===
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Let me think. Let me thinkÂOh! I donÂt care.
===
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Either, it makes no difference.
===
Choose, you jackass!
IÂll take a card.
===
What?!
This game is kinda fun.
===
 You donÂt think itÂs a little crazy that you get all my points just Âcause youÂ
I donÂt think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
===
Correct! ThereÂs a possible backwards bonus!
Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
===
Yes!
IÂd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
===
Wise choice, how many rungs?
Six!
===
 That noise can only me one thing.
 Hungry monkey.
===
 Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Tell it to the Time Turtle!
===
Now, over to Chandler.
IÂd like a Google Card.
===
Are you sure?
Yes!  No!  Google!
===
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youÂve been Bamboozled!
Nooo!!
===
Yeah!!
This is the best game ever!!!
===
 Hey!
Hey.
===
Oh my God, this is horrible!
IÂm so sorry.
===
Sure, I can hang out Âtil I have to meet ya.  What uhÂHow come youÂre not going?
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
===
I thought you already have a job.
And people say you donÂt pay attention. No, this is a much better job. ItÂs vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
===
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
ThatÂs what I do now.
===
No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, donÂt ya?
===
Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?
 Hey Phoebe!  Fatty!
===
Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Well, I got a job interview. ItÂs kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and IÂd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
===
Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Me! I do that. SoÂ Seriously, do I look okay? IÂm little nervous.
===
Yeah, just donÂt get your hopes up.
Why not?
===
Well, the interviewÂ
What about it?
===
YÂknow! You donÂt make a very good first impression.
 What?!
===
Oh you donÂt know.
Are you serious?!
===
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
What is it that I do?
===
Well itÂs just like youÂre trying too hard. Always making jokes, yÂknow, you justÂYou come off a little needy.
 Did you like me when we first met?
===
Oh! ItÂs okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Oh good. Good, because IÂm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
===
out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
An hour.
===
I canÂt help you.
Phoebe!
===
All right, all right, weÂll just do our best. Okay? So letÂs say IÂm the interviewer and IÂm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, IÂm uh, Regina Philange."
Chandler Bing.
===
Bing, what an unusual name.
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada.  IÂll let myself out.
===
Um-hmm, thatÂs good to know. But letÂs stop focusing on what you donÂt do, and start focusing on what you do do.
 What I do doÂis manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
===
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Hardest thing IÂve ever done in my life.
===
You gotta go!
Oh! 
===
Okay, donÂt worry. YouÂre ready.
Really?
===
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youÂll be great.
Okay.
===
You mustÂve had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.
===
So letÂs talk a little bit about your duties.
 My duties?  All right.
===
Now youÂll be heading a whole division, so youÂll have a lot of duties.
 I see.
===
But thereÂll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
 Good to know.
===
We can go into detailÂ
No donÂt I beg of you!
===
All right then, weÂll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youÂll fit in well here.
 Really?!
===
Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. YÂknow IÂve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.  Duties.  Duties!  Poo. 
===
Poo?
Oh my God this doesnÂt count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! ThereÂs a crazy guy out in the hall!
===
Poo?!
IÂll look forward to your call. 
===
 Oh Phoebe, thatÂs a great story. Can you tell it to me when youÂre getting me some iced tea?   Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
LetÂs. 
===
Well, well Ross didnÂt care enough to be here, so I think heÂs out. You snooze you lose.
HeÂs not snoozing, heÂs teaching a class.
===
Well then somebodyÂs snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. 
I havenÂt seen this dress.
===
 Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeÂBurrrrr! 
You really want to take me?
===
Yeah! Yeah! I mean IÂm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yÂknow Chandler always supported my career. HeÂs paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
So youÂre never actually going to pay me back?
===
ItÂs not just the stuff he paid for, I mean itÂs-itÂs everything. YÂknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnÂt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnÂt believe in myself.
I always knew you were gonna make it. IÂm so proud of you.
===
 IÂm gonna go shave. 
 Yeah well, IÂm gonna go spit. 
===
A little tall.
What?
===
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?  There you go. 
ItÂs just so glamorous.
===
You liked it? You really liked it?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
===
Which part exactly?
The whole thing! Can we go?
===
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
===
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
===
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnÂt take any of my suggestions! ThatÂs for coming buddy. IÂll see you later. 
DonÂt go! IÂm sorry. IÂm so sorry!  Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!  Or, call an ambulance.
===
Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
===
 Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
IÂm so sorry.
===
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? YouÂve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
What?!
===
Give me a number, I donÂt want to owe you anything!
You donÂt owe me anything, I donÂt want you moneyÂ
===
Ah-ah-ah! WeÂre doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
I donÂt know, five hundred dollars?
===
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
===
Okay, so thatÂs another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thatÂsÂ 
Do you want a calculator?
===
Please! 
Here! 
===
All right, what else?
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classesÂ
===
Which weÂre still keeping under our hats!
Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican. 
===
What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man."
Yes, money well spent!
===
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, foodÂ
===
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we canÂt guarantee a private room and currently theyÂre all unavailable.
Man, if only youÂd gotten here sooner. 
===
Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Yeah?
===
Listen uh, I-IÂve been doing some thinking, and I donÂt know whether itÂs because weÂre here or RachelÂs giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
Okay.
===
 What-what-whatÂs that now?!
Okay. IÂve been thinking about it too, and I, I think weÂre ready.
===
YouÂre ready to have a baby? My boyÂs all grown up!
But you said you were ready too.
===
Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Yes, but havenÂt you wanted a kid like forever?
===
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
IÂm not crazy about babies. IÂm crazy about us.
===
What?
Look, weÂve always talked about having babies someday. IÂm not saying it has to be right now, but IÂm starting to think that we can handle it. WeÂre good. WeÂre really good.
===
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
===
Well maybe IÂm ready now. I mean, itÂs a little scary, but maybe itÂs right.
What?! ItÂs not right! WeÂre not ready to have a kid now!!
===
What?!!
IÂm kidding. This is going to be fun.
===
So weÂre gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
WeÂre trying to get pregnant.  YÂknow IÂm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
===
Okay, hold on a sec.
Period math?
===
Yeah.
Yeah.
===
Well, we could start trying. Now.
Right here?
===
No, not here. Maybe here.
Wait a minute, itÂs perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and weÂre in a building thatÂs full of beds!
===
I think we found a place.
Okay. 
===
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Okay. Uh, weÂll dim the lights, dim the lights.  Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. 
===
Okay. LetÂs hurryÂOh wait! Do we have a condom?  Oh right! 
Yes, 98.6. YouÂre gonna be fine.
===
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
===
Does that sound like Janice?
If itÂs not, then thereÂs two of them. And that would mean itÂs the end of the world!
===
Hey!
Hi.
===
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youÂre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Weirdest thing. Did I hearÂÂMother of God itÂs true!
===
Chandler Bing!
Jan-Janice!
===
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
Janice I didnÂt even know you were pregnant! WhoÂs the unwitting human whoÂs essence youÂve stolen?
===
ItÂs you. This is yours.
What?!
===
 Look how nervous he gets! We havenÂt slept together in years! 
ThatÂs funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
===
Oh my God! SheÂs amazing. Oh, oh IÂm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
ItÂs incredible, I mean one minute sheÂs inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
===
Ohhh. 
So, do you know what youÂre gonna call her yet?
===
ThatÂs not her name! IÂm sorry, she just doesnÂt feel like an Isabella.
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
===
Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
You do?
===
Yeah, IÂve had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Oh no, itÂs gonna be named after some snack or baked good isnÂt it?
===
I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
===
WhereÂs my granddaughter? IÂve been practicing my magic tricks.
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
===
So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? 
Okay. Wow.
===
 Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
===
Dude I just did something terrible.
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
===
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
What?! Why does she think that?
===
Because it kinda looked like I did.
Again, what?!
===
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my handÂ
As we all are at some point during the day.
===
It wasnÂt my ring! It fell out of RossÂs jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
===
I guess.
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
===
I know! I know itÂs awful.
Well, what did she say?
===
 She said yes.
Does Ross know?
===
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
Well maybe you donÂt have to tell him anything.
===
Oh, I like that. YeahÂ
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
===
I want a baby.
Honey, weÂve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
===
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itÂll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closetÂs still available?
IÂm so tired.  Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
===
Well IÂm peeking.  Oh my God!
Hello sir, you know Monica.
===
Oh, I still canÂt believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnÂt make it to 
This is okay. WeÂre all adults here; thereÂs nothing to be ashamed of. Now, letÂs put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. 
===
Of course. IÂll always be your dad.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnÂt for fun.
===
It wasnÂt fun?!
 Why? Why-why-would youÂWh-whyÂ  Look, I just donÂt want you to think that weÂre animals who do it whenever we want.
===
Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. ThatÂs how I got my bad hip.
ThatÂs funny, this conversationÂs how I got the bullet hole in my head.
===
But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
===
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
Joey, you have to tell her whatÂs going on! And what did it look like?!
===
I didnÂt look at it. Stupid babyÂs head was blocking most of it.
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
===
Look, itÂs not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I donÂt want to hurt her.
Okay, look, just do it gently.
===
 Hey dad!
Hey.
===
 So sexy.  Honey.
Yea yea. 
===
Honey why donÂt you go lie down.
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?
===
WhyÂre you so tired?
CouldnÂt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldnÂt sleep.Â  YÂknow? I was like, if I fall asleep now IÂll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now IÂll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldnÂt fall asleep.
===
See this is what I was afraid of, I didnÂt think I should be here either but somebody  said heÂd be over it by now.
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
===
Ok if everyoneÂs on board, itÂs settled, Chandler,  Chandler?
Yep.
===
Are you on board?
 Yes.
===
Alright you guys, we canÂt turn on each other, Okay?Â  ThatÂs just what she wants.
 Hey.
===
Hey.
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
===
Oh IÂm kinda part of this.
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
===
Okay whatÂs up
Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
===
Oh yeah .
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
===
What? Who says that?
People whoÂve never ever been to Paris.
===
WhatÂs going on?
WeÂre moving to Tulsa! 
===
Excuse me?
Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
===
 Tulsa, Oklahoma!
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
===
Are you trying to tell me that weÂre moving to Oklahoma, or that youÂre gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  IÂll get out of it.
===
Thank you.
 What is wrong with Emma?
===
What?
ItÂs a funny story, actually.  I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said IÂd move to Tulsa, I didnÂt really know what I was saying.
===
You fell asleep?
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ainÂt that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, hereÂs the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wonÂt go. See, me, I love Tulsa!Â  Tulsa is heaven!Â  Tulsa is ItalyÂPlease donÂt make me go there!
===
Chandler, IÂ
No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?  Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping!  ThatÂs a picture of your daughter, isnÂt it, well sheÂs lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. IÂll call you from Tulsa. 
===
You know the book says that whenever sheÂs sleeping I should be sleeping soÂ 
 Hey!
===
Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Oh so there canÂt be any yelling.
===
No.
WeÂre moving to Tulsa
===
 What!?
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!  I canÂt, I canÂt hear you. 
===
You know, ah, IÂve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, itÂs not my fault. ItÂs a natural instinct.
 Hey, what you guys talking about?
===
Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the   way over here for?
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head   up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
===
How long do you have to go for?
They said it could be up to a year.
===
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid   thing 
There is nothing like the support of your loving   wife, huh?
===
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot,   but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be   able to make it.
===
You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this   group together!
Really?
===
Hey!
I've got good news!
===
You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.   You can stay here and keep your job. 
===
So you're gonna be gone four days a week?  No.
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
===
No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Really?
===
Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a   different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa. 
===
Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but   if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Hey, you said that without gagging!
===
Excuse me?
I know what she's talking about.
===
Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist.
He saw a therapist?
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
What are you doing?
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
===
That's so sweet. Find anything?
Slim Pickings.
===
Nothing, huh?
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.   They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're   looking for someone to shovel mesquite. 
===
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
===
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,   who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming   with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.   'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
===
You're right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.
What?
===
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,   Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
How far outside?
===
Manhattan.
And you're thinking of taking it?  So before   you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now   it's old job,  me,  new job. 
===
I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot   to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four   days a week'?
===
Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days   is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see   you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really   if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make   it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
I think you should take the job.
===
Really?
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you   start chattering like a monkey.
===
He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
===
Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's   a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,   he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy?
===
Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
===
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was   some guy that freaked everybody out.
Well, you got here just in time. I really have   to go buddy. 
===
Promise to call me when you land.
Of course I will call you. I love you.
===
Bye Chandler.
Awww.  Bye!
===
Bye honey. 
 What's the   matter Joe?
===
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big   leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make   all this easier?
===
Dude, you see right thru me!!  
Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
===
 Chandler, wait. It goes:   Old job,  new job,  you. This   is just something I have to do.
I know.
===
I love you so much.
I know that too. 
===
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our   wedding china today?
===
No, I think we should save our china for something   really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint. 
===
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive. 
What is the point of having them if we never use   them?
===
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen   comes over..
I will explain it to her.
===
Oh my God!
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime   soap Days of Our Lives? 
===
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really   good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.   They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00   AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot. 
Well you proved them wrong.
===
I know, after you left the store, I chose different   ones.
Why?
===
Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would   want Monica and Chandler. 
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma. 
===
Well actually...
Actually what? 
===
well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma   would go to my parents. 
What?
===
I lie better then that, right?
So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends   die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left   in my life gets taken away from me?
===
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner. 
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise   poorly? 
===
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.   I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of   Merlot and a five year old condom. 
Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong   father figure and I never will be. 
===
No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said   was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody   knows it. 
===
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because   I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard   parts. 
Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go   to your room! You're grounded"? 
===
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
You said that to me last week. 
===
Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't   know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I   want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. 
===
Mon, I'm so sorry. 
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize   to each other and mean it. 
===
Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel   dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. 
Oh yeah? Well thanks. 
===
So, so now do I get Joey?
Okay, but you should know he eats five times a   day and shoves pennies up his nose. 
===
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Nope...
===
Broke them all, huh?
Yep...
===
You gonna tell her?
Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna...   put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should   use these plates again for a looong time.
===
Like only if the queen comes?
Maybe not even then. 
===
 Uh-huh.
 Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
===
You're really not coming back?
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
===
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
So, who does?
===
I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
===
It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Thanks.  I'll see you New Year's Day.
===
 You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Did I not mention that?
===
No!
 AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! 
===
Hey.
Hey. Where've you been?
===
I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. 
 You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
===
My kid's in a play right now.
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
===
 "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
===
*Now* it feels like Christmas.
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
===
You can come to my house!
Haha, no thanks!
===
That was a nice pep-talk.
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
===
So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
===
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
===
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
What? That's terrible!
===
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
===
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
===
Oh no, we have to!
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
===
Well then, you should look with us.
Why?
===
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
===
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
===
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
OK, Pheebs, your turn.
===
You got me a cola drink?
And, a lemon lime.
===
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And last but not least.
===
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
 Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
===
What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
===
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
What?
===
 What are you doing?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
===
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Why?
===
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
===
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
===
 Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? 
Santa? Really?
===
Yeah, is that okay?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
===
No.
Then it's okaaay! 
===
Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
Ah. Thanks.
===
Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
Ah.  Chandler Bing.
===
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
===
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
===
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
I sent them home.
===
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
Uhh, uh...
===
 Answer faster, answer faster!
I don't know!
===
 Answer better, answer better!
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
===
What does she do there?
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
===
She did WHAT?
BE-LOW me!
===
*What*??
Well, she... she didn't win...
===
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
===
 Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
===
Okay.
I'm serious!
===
Okay!
Merry Christmas.
===
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, you guys!
===
Ah. Fun conversation?
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
===
Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? 
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
===
 ...Missy?
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
===
You are to me... 
 No,... no...  NO!  Look, I'm, I'm married!
===
So? I'm married. 
I'm *happily* married.
===
Oh. - What's *that* like?
Right. So, I'm sorry...
===
Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
===
Really?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
===
Well, not anymore.
But we don't do that.
===
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
===
Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
 That's the perfect amount!
===
 Y'know what's weird?
What?
===
This doesn't feel weird!
I know.
===
You're a really good kisser.
Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?
===
Hm-hmm!
Okay!
===
Wow! You are really fast!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
===
We're gonna see each other naked.
Yep!
===
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Count of three?
===
One!
Two!
===
Three! 
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
===
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Eh! 
===
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
===
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, so...
===
 Know when to stop.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
===
Yeah.  Don't do the dance.
Right!
===
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
===
You're so efficient. I love you!
Let's go! 
===
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
===
That'll work!
I don't think so.
===
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
 Here just...take this. 
===
That's stealing!
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
===
Ohh. 
Okay, one thing at a time. 
===
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Ehh.
===
Eh, you work for that.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
===
You do?!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
===
Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
===
You thought about that?
Yeah.
===
How many kids were we gonna have?
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
===
What else did you think about?
Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
===
 Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do.
===
No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
You sure?
===
Uh-hmm.
I love you so much.
===
What are you doing here?
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
===
Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
Monica.
===
Got ya. 
I never want to leave you again!
===
But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
===
What, you, you really quit your job?
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
===
What do you really want to do?
 I have *not* thought this through!
===
Oh my god!
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
===
No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
Thanks!
===
Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
 Ahh...
===
 Thank you.
 Here, pass these, will ya.. 
===
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
===
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
I don't have a *job*!
===
Hey. So where's Mon?
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
===
And you're not helping?
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice    - not helping.
===
Hey you guys!
 Hey! Happy birthday ...
===
Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Hi.
===
Yeah.
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
===
What? You really think she's hot?
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
===
Thank you! 
Now that Rachel's gone?
===
Would you stop staring at her?
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
===
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there    in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me    feel like I earned it.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
===
I think it's sweet. 
Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
===
Whazzup??
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
===
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep    an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
You don't trust him?
===
Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked    for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?    Because I could get a job any day now.
===
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm    sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do    this for me?
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know    as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,    he's going to have sex with it.
===
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.   
Picturing that tree?
===
For a walk.
Oh. You mind if I join you?
===
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
Your thoughts? Plural?
===
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta    see her!
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
===
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!    She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
===
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the    world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Great novels? 
===
Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
 I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
===
We have to stop them before something happens!
 Right behind you, big guy!  
===
 Hey
 Hi
===
Listen, I think I've left something here.
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
===
 No, but I like it. I think I left one of    my rat babies.
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
===
Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler and Monica are looking through   some papers.]
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
===
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since   I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all   our money?
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
===
I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than   we're bringing in.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
===
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask   you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...   finding gold.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal   out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next   month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's   refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing   soda and beer?
===
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
No! We're not borrowing money.
===
Why not?
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing   my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool   house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
===
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through   this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
===
Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
===
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal   your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look   like" 
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
===
We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Yes dear.
===
Central Perk. Chandler sits on the couch. Joey sits at the round table]
Hey Joe!
===
Hey!
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything   about it.
===
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
And that would have made the official party line.  Monica   and I are having a little financial trouble.
===
Yeah, I know.
What? What do you mean you know?
===
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and   the economy is bad.
Oh! Right.
===
 That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
===
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! 
===
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your   rent is. 
Oh ok.
===
Err... Kind of.
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
===
Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her.
What?
===
Something personal.
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she   wouldn't tell me about?
===
Thank you?
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing   I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...   single things.
===
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
===
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still   ok.
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.   I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more   specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
===
Okay...
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would   you? Don't answer that.
===
Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler enters. Rachel and monica   are seated at the table.]
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't change   a thing. Not a thing.
===
Honey?
Yeah?
===
About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
But honey you don't have to.
===
I'm going to get bigger!
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
===
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!   And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger   too.
your ass?!?!?
===
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
They...do that?
===
It's kind of a package deal!
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
===
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get   on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
===
Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to   be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present   that's shooting out of her!?
 What?
===
Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
It's over/Joe!
===
Hey hey, can I help?
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow   hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets   really tricky.
===
Someday.
Aaaaand....... hernia.
===
Ok... so... Goodbye.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
===
We're all sorry... 
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with   this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. 
===
Hey Ross, check this out!  yeah, I can't do that!
What are you doin'?
===
Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
===
It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
===
Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... 
Bet she'd sleep with you now... 
===
No... I already e-mailed her.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
===
 What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? 
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
===
Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
Oh, I'm so sorry!
===
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this... 
You're not gonna need my help?
===
Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth 
===
 I have sex with dinosaurs??
I believe I read that somewhere!
===
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...   It's not funny!!
I respectfully disagree.
===
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
===
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
I don't have a page.
===
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...   "gay as the day is long"?
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
===
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. 
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
===
 Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!  I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
===
What are you doing?
Oh, you'll see my friend.
===
 I'm dead?
 And so young.
===
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Well, how you died was funny.
===
Oh please, hit by a blimp?
It kills over one americans every year.
===
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
===
uhu uhu, check this out. 
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
===
Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
No, come on, you know that's not true.
===
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
===
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! 
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
===
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
===
Exactly!! 
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
===
No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
===
Hi, glad you could come.
 Please, come in.
===
Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
===
Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's... 
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps 
===
Who is he?
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
===
What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
 Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! 
===
 Hey, listen. Call me.
Ok! 
===
I look like a man??
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
===
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
===
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
===
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Kori? Kori Weston?
===
Yeah... 
Wow! You look amazing!
===
And you are... 
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
===
You are married though.
Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! 
===
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
===
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
===
Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
 Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
===
Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
===
Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
===
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
Are you really that busy?
===
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule.  "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it  Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time?  Oh, can't you make an exception?"
===
And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
 "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"  "Oh, thank you very much!"  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
===
Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
I don't have travel insurance.
===
Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
New York.
===
 The big apple!
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
===
I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
===
Not there.
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
===
 She doesn't know what to say!
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
===
Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
That's insane!
===
Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.
===
Great.
 What!? They are totally ripping us off!
===
Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
===
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Dude, you're shaking!
===
 Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. 
What did you get?
===
Nice, put it with the others.
And I also got... two more apples.
===
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!  
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
===
 I wish I'd thought this through.
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
===
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Ok, how about this ?
===
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Yes, but the batteries...
===
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
No!
===
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
===
Oh my god.
What?
===
There's something new in the bowl.
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
===
No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
There's a forest right outside.
===
It's not the same.
Ok, go quick!
===
 Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
 Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
===
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
I could fall asleep at a play.
===
early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
 Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
a career of talking about dinosaurs.
===
 Is he gonna introduce us?
 No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
===
everybody?
 Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
===
Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
 oh yes, God yes!!
===
How could he leave me
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
===
Oh, Very funny... Joey.
enjoy the play?
===
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
===
Oh really!
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
===
No!
Did somebody sign your bra?
===
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
===
Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
===
SURPRISE
I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?
===
Ok. 
 So, a professor, uh?
===
 Hey honey! I missed you today!
Oh, yeah?
===
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?
Oh, well... Maybe we could... 
===
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience!    Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
We really need to take those tests?
===
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
===
What is the big deal?
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
===
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
 I cannot believe Ross told you that!     And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
===
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea!
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
===
 OH!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
===
Mr. Bing?  Here you are! You'll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container.
Deposit my specimen? You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk. Thanks, got it.
===
Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok?
Yeah, I guess!
===
OH MY GOD!!
Oh, Come on!
===
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Why are you here?
===
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...
is    she here??
===
Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz    they have to do it in a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .
What!?
===
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!    
I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date... 
===
Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!
 I think it just fell off. 
===
Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
===
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
===
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
 Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
===
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
 oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe    I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
===
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?
 It was a "Wendy's!!    "
===
Hey sweetie.
Doctor Connelly just called.
===
With good news?  Of course    it is not good news, you just said  "Doctor Connelly just called".    If it was good news you would have said  "Doctor Connelly just    called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem    with me or with you?
Actually it's both of us.
===
What?
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment.
===
Oh... what does that mean?
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It    means...
===
Chandler?
 It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.
===
 Oh my God!
I'm sorry.
===
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
===
 Hi there.
Hi.
===
Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Oh, DAMN IT!
===
And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
===
Tsz... NO! .
 Hey guys!
===
Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
===
It's in Barbados.
But you come first!
===
Bye, see ya. 
 Ok.
===
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
===
So-so what did the doctor say?
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
===
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Yeah.
===
So, I don't have to learn what that means?
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
===
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
 ah-ha!
===
How do you feel about all this?
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
===
Hi honey!
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
===
 You too.
You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
===
Thanks.
 So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
===
Yeah, I guess.
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
===
 Excuse me?
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
===
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
===
Chandler!
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
===
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Ok!
===
Uh!
 Zack!
===
Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first.  Thanks!
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
===
gay
You don't like him.
===
about him... we should get more information.
Alright! Just follow my lead!
===
You guys have such a great place here.
Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
===
have an uncle who voted for  Dukakis.
 That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
===
Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
funny? Male Pattern Baldness 
===
Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Sure! Alright...
===
Ravioli's delicious!
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
===
Yess!! 
 We're teeth people Zack!
===
I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
===
No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
===
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
Ok.
===
Does seem pretty perfect.
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
===
 No.
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
===
No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Yeah, he's better!
===
No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Really? Are you sure?
===
Yeah, I'm sure.
 Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
===
That is so sweet. I love you. 
So you know this leaves us with...
===
Adoption.
How do you feel about that?
===
I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
===
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
 Yeah.
===
 Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
parents.
===
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
===
 Hey Chandler.
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
===
No you didn't.
Really?
===
No you did.
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
===
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
===
 See?
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
===
the time!
 She does?
===
 Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
===
Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
===
Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
===
I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
the kind of thing I do.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
===
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
What?
===
Why not? It's brilliant!  Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!  well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...  Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
===
 How do you think I should propose?
here!!
===
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
 I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
===
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
===
What?  Why?
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
===
again
advice!
===
extra body, ok?!
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
===
So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. 
Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!
===
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
 Nice! 
===
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
That would be advice!!
===
Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
===
If you want to check your email, just ask! 
 What?  May I?
===
It's not the time Charlie.
 Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
===
teapot?
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
===
Wha... what do you mean? 
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
===
What, oh my God. What did you do?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
===
Why, why would you open it?
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
===
it say?
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
===
NO! I don't!!
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
===
Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
I just feel awful.
===
Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... 
===
 Well, I hope you're happy!
 Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
===
Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
===
No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
And there's not chance that will work?
===
No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
 Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
===
Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
This vacation sucks!!
===
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
===
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
===
I have a ring.
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
===
 Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
===
The sun is out!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
===
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
===
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
 Not to mention the cold sores.
===
 Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
I don't think so!
===
 Why not?
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
===
 I punched you...?
And...?
===
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
I'm not playing with you.
===
Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
 Oh dear God, there's two of them!
===
Hell, yeah!
 Did you know this about him?
===
 One thousand...
 OK!
===
 No...  Either of you girls got a quarter?
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
===
AH YEAAAAH!
 Do you really find this attractive on him?
===
And that's how it's done! 
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
===
That's what I'm thinking.
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
===
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
 Ok, look! Enough is enough!
===
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
But...
===
Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
What about the obsessive cleaning?
===
 Aww! 
You ok?
===
I can't believe it!  I lost!
No, you didn't.
===
What?
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
===
 Honey, you don't have to do this.
 Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
===
suck
 You're welcome, sweetheart.
===
loser
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
===
Why?
I don't know.
===
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
why!
===
Yeah. It's actually our first official date 
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
===
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear   and self-loathing.
===
 It's OK!
How can you be so confident?
===
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Really? Like you have a routine?
===
No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have   to appreciate their uniqueness.
Really?
===
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.   Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
You mean like this? 
===
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. 
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. 
===
 Hey!
Hey!
===
 WOW!
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop   staring at your sister's legs!
===
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
===
 Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
 Why...why?
===
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,   it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can   really show it off.
===
Hey!
Hey Pheebs!
===
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me   too! She's the worst!
Who's Amanda?
===
She's this girl who used to live   in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up   this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Are you trying to do a British accent?
===
  Chandler gets   pedicures!
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
===
Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Hang on, sheâs right here.  Someone's on the phone, for ya.
===
We werenât picking up, itâs   Amanda!
 I get pedicures!
===
Oh! And it gets worse! 
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself!
===
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
How was your date with Joey?
===
Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away!
that?
===
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
===
Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly.
Well, aren't you a treat.
===
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that?
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys...
===
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?
Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
===
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
===
Dude, you're not tanned.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
===
 Hey guys!
Hey!
===
No,    that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday    was!
===
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.    You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
===
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this    party...
===
Hey!
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
===
Oh, she's still napping
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party    she knows is happening.
===
I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
I know, what are we gonna do?
===
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really    hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
===
 Yes, yes. I still want    my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with    nuts!
one does have nuts.
===
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message    to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
===
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.   You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in 
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together    and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. 
===
 Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right    there. 
Was that Emma? Is she up? 
===
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad    that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes    back here and all you guys are gone?
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday! 
===
Got it!  Hey hey hey!  Where do you think 
To the bathroom!
===
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! 
 What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! 
===
 Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you    guys in. 
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
===
Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
I'm begging you stop.
===
 Yeah!! Let's do that!
 That sounds more fun than the thing we were going    to do in Vermont! 
===
Ok! I want the dolphin!
Thats a bear.
===
Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! 
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
===
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
===
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly    stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog    never crossed the finish line, so technically...
They left.
===
Game?
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old,    that's little.
===
That's how old you are.
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
===
 Ooh, I want one...
Me too...
===
...and head to Canada!
I was kidding.
===
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
No, not yet.
===
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks    you guys!
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
===
What?
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? 
===
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow    out the candle. Come on Emma.
Let's do it, come on!
===
Of course, I'd be honored!
Thanks!
===
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
===
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby    adoption decider people..."
excited about your letter!
===
YEAH!
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
===
You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in 
That's where people make number two!!
===
Hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think youâll be very, very happy. Itâs the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
 I donât... uh... understand.
===
Of course it does! Itâs smart! I used the the-saurus!
word?
===
Oh, âThey are warm, nice, people with big heartsâ.
And that became âthey are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...?
===
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why donât you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself!
You know what? You donât need a thesaurus, just write from  here,  your full sized aortic pump.
===
anniversary ever.
last year.
===
Seriously?
Word!
===
I proposed to Chandler!  Alright,    moving on...
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
===
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?
think? 
===
Yeah.
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
===
Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
It's ok, it's ok. You know what?  I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. 
===
Okay good.
 Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
===
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way    to the bird store.
 They loved it.
===
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
That sounds like fun.
===
Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would    it?
I think she looks cute.     ... but I am wrong!
===
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
===
 O-Okay!
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
===
 Hi sweetie!
Is Monica not here?
===
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're    right for the part.
===
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!    Huh?  I'm old!  I'm tired!     Hey, I'm hot  I'm cold!! Huh??    Come on! What can't I do?
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think    you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
===
I can do that!  "Hello, I'm    your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.    I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Software that facilitates inter-business networking    e-solutions?
===
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for    the part.
===
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses!
Fine!
===
Thank you. 
Work, Joe!
===
Just pass it to your boss!
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest    him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should    learn on their own!
===
What's up?
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested.
===
 Oh.
 I'm sorry man.
===
 You didn't watch the tape.
 What!? Of course I did!
===
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
===
Well, you lied again! 
I watched it!
===
Keep going Pinocchio!
  I did!
===
 No you didn't! 
 I'm telling you, I watched the tape.    
===
a liar.
What did I just say?
===
You still here?
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am    insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
===
Now, what do you say?
Lying is wrong!
===
And?... AND?
I'm a pretty little girl.
===
Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
===
It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea    how expensive this stuff was!
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the    numbers.
===
So what did you two do about it?
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting    solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
===
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
 Maybe you do that next time you get married!
===
Hey!
Hey!
===
What's going on?
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning    the apartment.
===
 We?
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
===
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
===
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very    impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
 Little people?
===
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff    hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
What...? NO!
===
Chandler?
 I don't, and I'm offended    by the insinuation!
===
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes    taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not    mine.
===
Ok.
Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile. 
===
Yay!
But you already gave all your money to charity!
===
Well, Iâll just ask for it back!
I donât think you can do that!
===
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. Weâre really excited    about getting this process started.
Oh, because we love kids. Love âem to death.Well, not actually    to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...    as allowed by law.
===
Oh...
What?
===
Yes!
Of course it was!
===
So you're not friends with him?
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,    no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!
===
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
===
What's going on?
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!! 
===
Is he alright out there by himself?
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
===
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
Well, we're not.
===
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
We don't have a code word.
===
 What room should we see next?
Any room that isn't behind this couch! 
===
Ok, ok! 
Ok!
===
Oh my God!
And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And    we don't want to buy your bat! 
===
Are you friends with him?
I can explain... Joey...
===
 I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
Oh, that's really ok.
===
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...    Ok, goodbye. 
Wrong number?
===
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on    the waiting list.
That's great!
===
Previously on Friends...
How did the job stuff go?
===
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
===
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...    
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. 
===
You okay with this?
Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
===
Talking to Ross.
I see.
===
How is that gonna happen?
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
===
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next    door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna    take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse    us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
===
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
What do you think Pheebs?
===
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin    Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Yeah.
===
She died.
You're kidding!
===
Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across    the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the    wrong one.
Oh yeah? 
===
Joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    Atlantic.
===
Thanks.
It feels like weâre cheating on our house.    And if weâre gonna cheat, shouldnât it be with like a hot, younger house,    that does stuff that our house wonât do?
===
No, actually, we're buying the house next door. 
 Why!?
===
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.    Maybe the 
The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the Hitlers.
===
Okay, you come up with an idea.
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house. We can still get out.
